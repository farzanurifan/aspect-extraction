0,those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it . ,0,0
1,the price is way below an ipod of the same size . ,0,0
2,the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod . ,0,1
3,the sound quality is very good . ,1,0
4,"the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . ",1,0
5,"because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it . ",0,1
6,"for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection . ",0,1
7,having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . ,1,1
8,they fall in love with the product . ,0,1
9,and then it breaks . ,0,1
10,usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires . ,0,1
11,"typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . ",1,1
12,the nomad is sent back to creative labs . ,0,0
13,"they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it . ",0,1
14,"in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it . ",0,1
15,"like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it . ",0,0
16,"if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two . ",0,1
17,"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . ",1,0
18,the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . ,1,1
19,"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . ",1,1
20,the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . ,1,0
21,"even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty . ",0,1
22,and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase . ,0,0
23,"this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it . ",0,0
24,"so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad . ",0,0
25,you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back . ,0,1
26,you will have a very expensive paperweight . ,0,0
27,there are not a lot of good options out there . ,0,0
28,"most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery . ",0,0
29,my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops . ,0,0
30,"maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again . ",0,0
31,maybe more competitors will bring out similar products . ,0,1
32,and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod . ,0,1
33,"whatever you do , do n't buy this product . ",0,0
34,you will be sorry if you do . ,0,1

37,"the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . ",1,0
38,it says i have a harddisk problem . ,0,0
39,and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty . ,0,1
40,it worked good for a while . ,0,1
41,it did lock up on me a couple of times . ,0,1
42,and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk . ,0,0

45,the batteries would not charge . ,0,1
46,so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model . ,0,0
47,in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . ,1,0
48,"it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem . ",0,1
49,"so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty ! ",0,1
50,it always pays off . ,0,1

57,the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . ,1,1
58,"the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . ",1,1
