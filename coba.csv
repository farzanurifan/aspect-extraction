84,i was considering the olympus-camedia-c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . ,,
85,"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery-life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery-life as the canon-g3 . ",,|camera|type|olympus|bit|canon-g3

178,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . ",g3!+,quality|reputation
179,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag-time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . ",lag time!-,light|lag-time|quality|flash

181,"at least once youve got focus-lock , the shutter-release-lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . ",,anything
182,what makes the focus-lock lag-time-something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . ,depth!+,field|depth|point|f8

184,now what about the flash-problem ? ,,
185,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon-slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . ",flash!-,|flash|g3

189,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter-speed and f-stop yourself . ",,|mode
190,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . ",flash!+,canon
191,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter-sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . ",,|shutter-sync
192,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz-flash-head itself and the sca 3102 control-panel , because they are all ignored . ",,
193,"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz-flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz-flash itself . ",,youve|range
194,"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . ",,
195,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz-flash are no longer available , so the first problem-cant easily be solved . ",,density|metz-flash
196,the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . ,,
197,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon-f100-film camera . ",,|range|exposure|youve|camera

200,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image-mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte-cf with a 512 mbyte-cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !

324,cameras capture moments . ,,

329,"not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . ",,
330,"like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . ",,
331,so buy the g3 . ,,
332,"buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . ",,
333,"but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film-camera ] to stop the moment you choose . ",,|ability|g3|film-camera

493,"yes there is a corner-lens-barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea-lcd-screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens-distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax-phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . ",distortion!-,
494,moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens-distortion but increase the parallax-phenomenon . ,,
495,the distortion is not a flaw . ,,distortion
496,"as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect-compactflash and other digicam-brand . ",,notice|notice|compactflash|digicam-brand
497,i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this . ,,
498,"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! ",shot!+,camera
499,the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . ,picture!+,
500,"in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium-battery . ",,|litium-battery
501,"based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots . ",,charge
502,i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max-picture-quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb-subnotebook with usb-connection and tons of hard drive-space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash . ,,flash|viking|resolution|max-picture-quality|drive-space|usb-connection|3lb-subnotebook
503,the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it . ,,flash|hate
504,"anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 . ",,canon|g2
505,it 's a winner . ,,
506,"i 've been pleased with the picture-quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . ",picture quality!+,
507,my only suggestion is to get a lens-protector to help protect the shooting-lens ( the lens-coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm-adapter and uv-lens-filter ) at lensmateonline.com . ,,|suggestion
508,they got the best lens-adapter for the g3-better than canon 's . ,,lens-adapter|g3-better|canon
509,that 's what i did and hopes this helps . ,,
510,the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . ,camera!+,
511,"it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . ",picture!+,
512,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens-barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens-viewfinder ; however , the lcd-viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens-viewfinder .

514,"you see , i can 't-rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r-camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product . ",,
515,"although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate-store that you 've never heard of . ",,|rate-store
516,"after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product . ",,
517,"i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" . ",,
518,"one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" . ",,
519,so why lie about it ? ,,
520,so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet . ,,
521,"although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it . ",,
522,"they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" . ",,
523,"they were n't busy enough to charge the credit-card , though ! ",,
524,"although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint . ",,time

528,this camera has a major design-flaw . ,design!-,|design-flaw|camera
529,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . ,viewfinder!-,|corner|picture
530,i called the canon technical service-center to see if i had a defective camera . ,,camera
531,"after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view-finder , they finally admitted , it was a design-flaw in the camera . ",,
532,everything else about the camera is great . ,camera!+,everything|camera
533,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view-finder , i highly recommend the camera . ",camera!+,camera
534,"however for me , i occasionally use the view-finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much . ",,|frame
535,i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected . ,,
536,"i 've been using a powershot-s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel-camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control . ",,shoe|zoom|flash|flash|control
537,"i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon-g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price . ",,|g3|coolpix|canon-g3
538,i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . ,,
539,"and so far , i 've been very pleased . ",camera!+,
540,"there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel-image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures . ",,|difference|quality
541,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture-quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . ",lens!+,picture-quality|light|lens
542,the moveable lcd-screen is great . ,lcd!+,lcd-screen
543,"you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself . ",,shot
544,"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . ",remote!+,unit
545,"i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before . ",,tripod|camera|control|combination
546,the hot shoe-flash-attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash-unit : ,hot shoe flash!+,shoe-flash-attachment|flash-unit
547,i chose the canon-speedlite 420 . ,,
548,"this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash-unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .

549,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : ",battery!+,|powerhouse|battery|g3
550,i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday-party without switching out to my backup-battery . ,,

552,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter-priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . ",manual!+,manual|shutter-priority|priority|metering
553,"you can use this camera-right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do . ",,

555,"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . ",highlight!-,
556,( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . ) ,,|photography
557,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . ",no-off button!-,button
558,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel-heft of the s330 . ",body!-,steel-heft|disappointment|s330
559,"i bought a 512 mb-card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution . ",,
560,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . ",download!+,
561,i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : ,,|drive|gb
562,i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly . ,,|memory|ibook
563,"at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough . ",,|time|t

565,"and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers . ",,

568,added 2-24 . ,,
569,i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . ,camera!+,
570,i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom-white-balance-setting . ,,|card|wound

572,"if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper . ",,|card|paper|piece
573,"i also discovered the exposure-bracket-setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker . ",,exposure-bracket-setting|exposure
574,especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations . ,,

580,"after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image-quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .

585,"the canon-g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture-quality and battery-life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel-camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel-camera .
