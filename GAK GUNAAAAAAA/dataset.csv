they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,picture[+2]
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,picture quality[+1]
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,picture quality[+1]
"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,"camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]"

i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,

i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! ,0,Canon_G3.txt,

it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,price[-3][u]

i do n't think i was asking too much . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,camera[-3]
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
that meant even less light and just as much action . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,

"i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,g3[+1]
"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,"lag time[-2],flash[-2]"
"as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,depth[+1]
"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
now what about the flash problem ? ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,flash[-2]
"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,external flash hot shoe[+1]
"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,flash[+2]
"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !

"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . ",1,Canon_G3.txt,software[-2]
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
i didnt wait to experiment . ,0,Canon_G3.txt,
"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,g3[+3]
"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! ",1,Canon_G3.txt,color[+3]
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,"g3[+3],software[-2]"
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,software[-2]
"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . ",0,Canon_G3.txt,
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . ,1,Canon_G3.txt,image[+3]

one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online . ,0,Nokia_6610.txt,
