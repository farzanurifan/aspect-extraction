31,"i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . ",phone,
32,i was surprised by t-mobile 's service . ,,
33,"i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . ",t-mobile reception,reception|service
34,reason ? ,,
35,they piggy-back on cingular 's service . ,,
36,"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . ",t-zone,mo.
37,"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" . ",customer service,

40,by what time standards -- martian ? ,,
41,"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . ",t-mobile,t-mobile
42,"also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out . ",,service
43,"in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . ",customer rep,customer
44,"but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you . ",,habit
