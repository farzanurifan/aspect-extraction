237,my opinions : ,,
238,"personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. . ",,
239,i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . ,interface!+,interface!easy|nx!remote
240,it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list . ,,playlist!clear|option!playlist
241,"meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list . ",,list!clear
242,the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . ,folder structure!-,deal!cons|way!cons|structure!cons|folder!deal|title!structure
243,and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. ,chinese name!-,man!work|title!work|player!work

247,i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand . ,,
248,not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . ,transfer!+,transfer!painless|pc!transfer

250,"and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done . ",,
251,"in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ). ",,
252,so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about . ,,|review!previous

460,when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website . ,,|unit!downloaded
461,the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions . ,,upgrade!smoothly
462,i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation . ,,chance!best|upgrade!recommend|operation!trouble|trouble!best
463,storage : ,,
464,the storage capacity is great . ,storage!+,capacity!great|storage!great
465,i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb . ,,
466,i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet . ,,
467,i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place . ,,
468,"for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels . ",,
469,typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. ,,
470,the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size . ,,number!better|size!better|quality!better|file!number
471,if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps . ,,
472,you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player . ,,|rate!much
473,"if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ). ",,

475,the price compared to the ipod is great . ,price!+,price!great

491,through the software you can classify songs in genres . ,,

493,the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . ,software!+,
494,you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications . ,,
495,you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later . ,,
496,this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass . ,,
497,"in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player . ",,|addition!equivalent

779,"in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it . ",,
780,so what 's the problem ? ,,
781,i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device . ,,
782,i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 . ,,
783,i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me . ,,nomad!work
784,the reasons below will be true for any product in this category . ,,
785,here 's why : ,,
786,1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office . ,,
787,i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation . ,,
788,2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . ) ,,
789,3 . it 's a hazard in the car . ,,
790,"the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . ",navigation!+,navigation!nice
791,( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a . ,,
792,creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . ,playlist!-,software!issue
793,the bottom line : ,,|line!bottom
794,"if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk . ",,player!portable|cd/mp3!portable
795,"sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks . ",,school!easier
796,one major complaint : ,,
797,my only significant complaint is sound quality . ,sound quality!-,quality!complaint|complaint!sound
798,the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . ,eax!-,eq!limited|feature!enough|custom!limited|band!eq

803,one minor complaint : ,,

805,gee ... thanks a lot creative . ,,
806,well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players . ,,beginning!well

848,hope i helped ! ,,hope!helped
849,i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. . ,,
850,what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. . ,,product!great|source!open
851,based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. . ,,

853,now we come to the zen xtra .. . ,,
854,first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . ,player hardware!+,hardware!good
855,the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . ,sound!+,sound!excellent|form!bad|factore!bad
856,what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . ,software!-,player!mediocre|mp3!mediocre|software!player
857,not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software . ,,experience!horrible|software!horrible|transfer!software|player!software

862,"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . ",playlist!-,
863,"well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. . ",,
864,i 'll just say this .. . ,,
865,for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ... ,,player!satisfactory|listener!satisfactory|music!average|mp3!satisfactory
866,but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product . ,,

878,"i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead . ",,
879,my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer . ,,

883,my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . ,tag!-,|concern!only|process!only|way!process
884,"when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks . ",,
885,"while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd . ",,process!accurate|listing!accurate|reliance!accurate|amg!accurate
886,"the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance . ",,|artist!same|number!cd|performance!artist|performance!artist
887,"for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock . ",,rock!classic|rock!classic|cd!live|hendrix!live|example!cd|fillmore!east
888,perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock . ,,
889,"you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it . ",,|information!downloaded
890,a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names . ,,|set!same|set!different
891,this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad . ,,
892,"again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you . ",,|variation!minor|title!minor|front!title|disk!other
893,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . ,tag!-,system!problems
894,"if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second . ",,|name!same|option!second
895,"this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi . ",,music!popular|kind!popular
896,i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately . ,,|song!same
897,the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing . ,,
898,"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . ",software!-,software!ignore|software!ignore|order!alphabetical
899,"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . ",playlist!-,computer!complicated|order!alphabetical
900,"in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it . ",,
901,"you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately . ",,
902,"you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist . ",,

959,mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them . ,,drive!hard|memory!hard
960,the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact . ,,memory!expensive|flash!expensive|card!expensive
961,that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size . ,,

963,mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory . ,,|mp3!small|kind!small

966,hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) . ,,
967,"cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around . ",,
968,"that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory . ",,|lot!mp3
969,just be aware of it . ,,
970,this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players . ,,pricing!weird
971,"a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more . ",,
972,it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive . ,,memory!lighter|flash!lighter|drive!hard|player!30gb

1570,i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad . ,,
1571,the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me . ,,|look!white|ipod!white|surface!look|plastic!white
1572,"i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . ",color!+,color!better|nomad!better
1573,the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage . ,,look!best|ipod!best
1574,"my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them . ",,|space!much|storage!much
1575,i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . ,player!+,
1576,the pros : ,,
1577,price ! ,price!+,
1578,almost half what an ipod would cost you ! ,,
1579,i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me . ,,size!important

1581,yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . ,earphone!-,
1582,i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . ,interface!+,song!enough|playlist!enough
1583,i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! ,playlist!+,fact!liked
1584,cons . ,,
1585,creative software stinks . ,software!-,software!stinks
1586,it 's horrible . ,,
1587,redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more ! ,,software!nice|redchair!nice

1589,have had the player since xmass and love it ! ,player!+,
1590,pros : ,,

1594,neutral : ,,
1595,i did n't even try the included software . ,,

1599,here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail : ,,
1600,look / design : ,,
1601,"the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . ",size!+,system!terrific|imo!better|size!system|design!size
1602,"it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods . ",,|inch!only
1603,"it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . ",build!+,feel!nice
1604,i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . ,control!+,
1605,"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . ",scroll wheel!+,wheel!better|scroll!better|nudge!risk|ipod!better|cramp!risk|finger!risk
1606,the screen 's large and easily read . ,screen!+,|screen!large
1607,"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . ",pop-up face!-,|beef!only
1608,"sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . ",sound!+,sound!exceptional
1609,from what i 've heard it 's at least equal . ,,
1610,"like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels . ",,
1611,"there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far . ",,background!hiss
1612,interface - practically seamless . ,interface!+,interface!seamless
1613,"songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver . ",,|player!previous|folder!previous|iriver!previous
1614,yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . ,id3 tag!+,
1615,"it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better . ",,music!dedicated|music!better
1616,"you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search . ",,
1617,"playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . ",playlist!+,fly!clunky|bit!fly|bonus!fly|software!fly
1618,the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . ,balance!-,|thing!only|option!only
1619,software : ,,
1620,"as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . ",mediasource!+,software!robust|mediasource!robust|notmad!work
1621,"it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . ",mediasource!+,
1622,"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . ",id3 tag!+,point!strong|editing!strong|id3!in-program|tag!point
1623,it was no problem for me to use their software . ,software!+,
1624,"some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive . ",,player!portable|music!portable|drive!hard|accessory!portable
1625,the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience . ,,
1626,"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .

1627,"so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer . ",,customer!happy
1628,please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . ,equipment!+,piece!superior|equipment!superior
1629,do n't buy this player . ,player!-,
1630,i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless . ,,
1631,"unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . "" ",player!-,player!unfortunately
1632,it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do . ,,|service!further
1633,do n't buy this player . ,player!-,
1634,do not buy this product -- ,product!-,
1635,i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . ,player!-,care!perfect|player!perfect|warranty!lousy|day!lousy
1636,nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke . ,,
1637,"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . ",software!-,software!good|blaster!other
1638,"ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one . ",,|week!previous
1639,"honestly , i love this player . ",player!+,player!love
1640,"one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one . ",,
1641,"once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . ",sound!+,sound!awesome|life!batterly|battery!batterly
1642,"ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me . ",,player!breaks|jack!fortunately|ok!jack|stuff!player|headfone!ok
1643,"however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . ",hard drive!-,drive!fail
1644,"therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) . ",,|xtra!next|zen!next|replacement!same|replacement!next

1646,"if it does , ill give up . ",,
1647,"basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed . ",,drive!failed
1648,thats it . ,,
1649,"i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back . ",,
1650,"the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now . ",,thing!good|process!good
1651,"basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 . ",,
1652,you know why ? ,,
1653,"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . ",break!+,player!awesome
1654,"now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind . ",,player!love
1655,i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . . ,,
1656,"honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players . ",,goddam!best|cd!best
1657,this is all i have to say . ,,
1658,what a junk . ,player!-,
1659,every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . ,freeze!-,file!corrupt|os!freezes|time!nomad
1660,the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode . ,,|way!only
1661,so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home . ,,nomad!frozen
1662,after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox . ,,
1663,the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months . ,,
1664,those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it . ,,|nomad!few
1665,the price is way below an ipod of the same size . ,,|size!same|ipod!same
1666,the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod . ,,|ipod!nomad
1667,the sound quality is very good . ,sound quality!+,quality!good
1668,"the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . ",control!-,
1669,"because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it . ",,|capacity!large|nomad!large
1670,"for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection . ",,
1671,having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . ,storage!+,access!terrific|music!much
1672,they fall in love with the product . ,,
1673,and then it breaks . ,,
1674,usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires . ,,
1675,"typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . ",headphone jack!-,jack!problem|headphone!problem
1676,the nomad is sent back to creative labs . ,,
1677,"they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it . ",,|owner!responsible|damage!owner
1678,"in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it . ",,
1679,"like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it . ",,product!abused
1680,"if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two . ",,level!good|care!good
1681,"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . ",design!-,|experience!own|use!normal
1682,the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . ,headphone jack!-,jack!problem|problem!jack
1683,"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . ",front cover!-,|thing!other|cover!front
1684,the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . ,headphone jack!-,period!expire
1685,"even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty . ",,owner!damage|damage!owner
1686,and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase . ,,
1687,"this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it . ",,nomad!enough|lot!enough
1688,"so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad . ",,
1689,you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back . ,,
1690,you will have a very expensive paperweight . ,,paperweight!expensive
1691,there are not a lot of good options out there . ,,lot!good
1692,"most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery . ",,
1693,my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops . ,,
1694,"maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again . ",,design!better|design!creative
1695,maybe more competitors will bring out similar products . ,,
1696,and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod . ,,
1697,"whatever you do , do n't buy this product . ",,
1698,you will be sorry if you do . ,,
1699,i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now . ,,
1700,i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month . ,,
1701,"the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . ",lock up!-,|day!other
1702,it says i have a harddisk problem . ,,
1703,and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty . ,,
1704,it worked good for a while . ,,
1705,it did lock up on me a couple of times . ,,
1706,and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk . ,,
1707,i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ). ,,|jukebox!first
1708,unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it . ,,
1709,the batteries would not charge . ,,
1710,so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model . ,,
1711,in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . ,hard drive!-,drive!died|model!drive|morning!drive
1712,"it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem . ",,drive!bad|player!bad|nothing!major|mp3!hard|problem!drive
1713,"so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty ! ",,|warranty!extended|rule!warranty|matter!rule
1714,it always pays off . ,,
1715,hope i 've been of some help . ,,
