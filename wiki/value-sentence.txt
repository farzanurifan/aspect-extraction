a price is the quantity of payment or compensation given by one party to another in return for one unit of goods or services.
a price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions.
in modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency.
(for commodities, they are expressed as currency per unit weight of the commodity, e.
) although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen.
prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles.
in some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during world war ii.
in a black market economy, barter is also relatively common.
in many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways.
the most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest.
the total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan.
other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets.
for instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued.
"price" sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount.
this requested amount is often called the asking price or selling price, while the actual payment may be called the transaction price or traded price.
likewise, the bid price or buying price is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or services, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets than in consumer markets.
economic price theory asserts that in a free market economy the market price reflects interaction between supply and demand: the price is set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded.
in turn these quantities are determined by the marginal utility of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers.
supply and demand, and hence price, may be influenced by other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion.
when a commodity is for sale at multiple locations, the law of one price is generally believed to hold.
this essentially states that the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more.
== price and value ==.
the paradox of value was observed and debated by classical economists.
adam smith described what is now called the diamond – water paradox: diamonds command a higher price than water, yet water is essential for life and diamonds are merely ornamentation.
use value was supposed to give some measure of usefulness, later refined as marginal benefit  while exchange value was the measure of how much one good was in terms of another, namely what is now called relative price.
== austrian school theory ==.
one solution offered to the paradox of value is through the theory of marginal utility proposed by carl menger, one of the founders of the austrian school of economics.
as william barber put it, human volition, the human subject, was "brought to the centre of the stage" by marginalist economics, as a bargaining tool.
neoclassical economists sought to clarify choices open to producers and consumers in market situations, and thus "fears that cleavages in the economic structure might be unbridgeable could be suppressed".
without denying the applicability of the austrian theory of value as subjective only, within certain contexts of price behavior, the polish economist oskar lange felt it was necessary to attempt a serious integration of the insights of classical political economy with neo-classical economics.
this would then result in a much more realistic theory of price and of real behavior in response to prices.
marginalist theory lacked anything like a theory of the social framework of real market functioning, and criticism sparked off by the capital controversy initiated by piero sraffa revealed that most of the foundational tenets of the marginalist theory of value either reduced to tautologies, or that the theory was true only if counter-factual conditions applied.
one insight often ignored in the debates about price theory is something that businessmen are keenly aware of: in different markets, prices may not function according to the same principles except in some very abstract (and therefore not very useful) sense.
from the classical political economists to michal kalecki it was known that prices for industrial goods behaved differently from prices for agricultural goods, but this idea could be extended further to other broad classes of goods and services.
== price as productive human labour time ==.
marxists assert that value derives from the volume of socially necessary labour time exerted in the creation of an object.
this value does not relate to price in a simple manner, and the difficulty of the conversion of the mass of values into the actual prices is known as the transformation problem.
however, many recent marxists deny that any problem exists.
marx was not concerned with proving that prices derive from values.
in fact, he admonished the other classical political economists (like ricardo and smith) for trying to make this proof.
rather, for marx, price equals the cost of production (capital-cost and labor-costs) plus the average rate of profit.
so if the average rate of profit (return on capital investment) is 22% then prices would reflect cost-of-production plus 22%.
the perception that there is a transformation problem in marx stems from the injection of walrasian equilibrium theory into marxism where there is no such thing as equilibrium.
== confusion between prices and costs of production ==.
price is commonly confused with the notion of cost of production, as in "i paid a high cost for buying my new plasma television"; but technically these are different concepts.
price is what a buyer pays to acquire products from a seller.
cost of production concerns the seller's expenses (e.
for marketing organizations seeking to make a profit, the hope is that price will exceed cost of production so that the organization can see financial gain from the transaction.
finally, while pricing is a topic central to a company's profitability, pricing decisions are not limited to for-profit companies.
the behavior of non-profit organizations, such as charities, educational institutions and industry trade groups, also involve setting prices.
for instance, charities seeking to raise money may set different "target" levels for donations that reward donors with increases in status (e.
furthermore, while nonprofit organizations may not earn a "profit", by definition, it is the case that many nonprofits may desire to maximize net revenue—total revenue less total cost—for various programs and activities, such as selling seats to theatrical and cultural performances.
== price point ==.
the price of an item is also called the "price point", especially where it refers to stores that set a limited number of price points.
for example, dollar general is a general store or "five and dime" store that sets price points only at even amounts, such as exactly one, two, three, five, or ten dollars (among others).
other stores will have a policy of setting most of their prices ending in 99 cents or pence.
other stores (such as dollar stores, pound stores, euro stores, 100-yen stores, and so forth) only have a single price point ($1, £1, €1, ¥100), though in some cases this price may purchase more than one of some very small items.
== other terms ==.
basic price is the price a seller gets after removing any taxes paid by a buyer and adding any subsidy the seller gets for selling.
producer price is the amount the producer gets from a buyer for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax, it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.
price optimization is the use of mathematical techniques by a company to determine how customers will respond to different prices for its products and services through different channels.

economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent.
it is generally measured relative to units of currency, and the interpretation is therefore "what is the maximum amount of money a specific actor is willing and able to pay for the good or service"?.
among the competing schools of economic theory there are differing theories of value.
economic value is not the same as market price, nor is economic value the same thing as market value.
if a consumer is willing to buy a good, it implies that the customer places a higher value on the good than the market price.
the difference between the value to the consumer and the market price is called "consumer surplus".
it is easy to see situations where the actual value is considerably larger than the market price: purchase of drinking water is one example.
== overview ==.
the economic value of a good or service has puzzled economists since the beginning of the discipline.
first, economists tried to estimate the value of a good to an individual alone, and extend that definition to goods which can be exchanged.
from this analysis came the concepts value in use and value in exchange.
value is linked to price through the mechanism of exchange.
when an economist observes an exchange, two important value functions are revealed: those of the buyer and seller.
just as the buyer reveals what he is willing to pay for a certain amount of a good, so too does the seller reveal what it costs him to give up the good.
additional information about market value is obtained by the rate at which transactions occur, telling observers the extent to which the purchase of the good has value over time.
said another way, value is how much a desired object or condition is worth relative to other objects or conditions.
economic values are expressed as "how much" of one desirable condition or commodity will, or would be given up in exchange for some other desired condition or commodity.
among the competing schools of economic theory there are differing metrics for value assessment and the metrics are the subject of a theory of value.
value theories are a large part of the differences and disagreements between the various schools of economic theory.
== explanations of value ==.
in neoclassical economics, the value of an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market.
this is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply in a perfectly competitive market.
many neoclassical economic theories equate the value of a commodity with its price, whether the market is competitive or not.
as such, everything is seen as a commodity and if there is no market to set a price then there is no economic value.
in classical economics, the value of an object or condition is the amount of discomfort/labor saved through the consumption or use of an object or condition (labor theory of value).
though exchange value is recognized, economic value is not, in theory, dependent on the existence of a market and price and value are not seen as equal.
this is complicated, however, by the efforts of classical economists to connect price and labor value.
karl marx, for one, saw exchange value as the "form of appearance" [erscheinungsform] of value, which implies that, although value is separate from exchange value, it is meaningless without the act of exchange, i.
in this tradition, steve keen makes the claim that "value" refers to "the innate worth of a commodity, which determines the normal ('equilibrium') ratio at which two commodities exchange.
" to keen and the tradition of david ricardo, this corresponds to the classical concept of long-run cost-determined prices, what adam smith called "natural prices" and karl marx called "prices of production.
" it is part of a cost-of-production theory of value and price.
ricardo, but not keen, used a "labor theory of price" in which a commodity's "innate worth" was the amount of labor needed to produce it.
"the value of a thing in any given time and place", according to henry george, "is the largest amount of exertion that anyone will render in exchange for it.
but as men always seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion this is the lowest amount for which a similar thing can otherwise be obtained.
"in another classical tradition, marx distinguished between the "value in use" (use-value, what a commodity provides to its buyer), labor cost which he calls "value" (the socially-necessary labour time it embodies), and "exchange value" (how much labor-time the sale of the commodity can claim, smith's "labor commanded" value).
by most interpretations of his labor theory of value, marx, like ricardo, developed a "labor theory of price" where the point of analyzing value was to allow the calculation of relative prices.
others see values as part of his sociopolitical interpretation and critique of capitalism and other societies, and deny that it was intended to serve as a category of economics.
according to a third interpretation, marx aimed for a theory of the dynamics of price formation, but did not complete it.
in 1860, john ruskin published a critique of the economic concept of value from a moral point of view.
he entitled the volume unto this last, and his central point was this: "it is impossible to conclude, of any given mass of acquired wealth, merely by the fact of its existence, whether it signifies good or evil to the nation in the midst of which it exists.
its real value depends on the moral sign attached to it, just as strictly as that of a mathematical quantity depends on the algebraic sign attached to it.
any given accumulation of commercial wealth may be indicative, on the one hand, of faithful industries, progressive energies, and productive ingenuities: or, on the other, it may be indicative of mortal luxury, merciless tyranny, ruinous chicanery.
" gandhi was greatly inspired by ruskin's book and published a paraphrase of it in 1908.
economists such as ludwig von mises asserted that "value", meaning exchange value, was always the result of subjective value judgements.
there was no price of objects or things that could be determined without taking these judgements into account, as manifested by markets.
thus, it was false to say that the economic value of a good was equal to what it cost to produce or to its current replacement cost.
silvio gesell denied value theory in economics.
he thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.
value in the most basic sense can be referred to as "real value" or "actual value".
this is the measure of worth that is based purely on the utility derived from the consumption of a product or service.
utility derived value allows products or services to be measured on outcome instead of demand or supply theories that have the inherent ability to be manipulated.
illustration: the real value of a book sold to a student who pays $50.
00 at the cash register for the text and who earns no additional income from reading the book is essentially zero.
however; the real value of the same text purchased in a thrift shop at a price of $0.
25 and provides the reader with an insight that allows him or her to earn $100,000.
00 in additional income is $100,000.
00 or the extended lifetime value earned by the consumer.
this is value calculated by actual measurements of roi instead of production input and or demand vs.
supply.
no single unit has a fixed value.
== connected concepts ==.
the theory of value is closely related to that of allocative efficiency, the quality by which firms produce those goods and services most valued by society.
the market value of a machine part, for example, will depend upon a variety of objective facts involving its efficiency versus the efficiency of other types of part or other types of machine to make the kind of products that consumers will value in turn.
in such a case, market value has both objective and subjective components.
economy, efficiency and effectiveness, often referred to as the "three es", may be used as complementary factors contributing to an assessment of the value for money provided by a purchase, project or activity.
the uk national audit office uses the following summaries to explain the meaning of each term:.
economy: minimising the cost of resources used or required (inputs) – spending less;.
efficiency: the relationship between the output from goods or services and the resources to produce them – spending well; and.
effectiveness: the relationship between the intended and actual results of public spending (outcomes) – spending wisely.
sometimes a fourth 'e', equity, is also added.
in philosophy, economic value is a subcategory of a more general philosophical value, as defined in goodness and value theory or in the science of value.
