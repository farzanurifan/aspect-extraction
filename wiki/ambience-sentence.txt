a theme restaurant is a type of restaurant that uses theming to attract diners by creating a memorable experience.
theme restaurants have a unifying or dominant subject or concept, and utilize architecture, decor, special effects, and other techniques, often to create exotic environments that are not normally associated with dining because they are inaccessible, no longer exist, are fictional or supernatural, or taboo.
the theme may be further extended through the naming and choices of food, though food is usually secondary to entertaining guests.
== classification ==.
most restaurants have an inherent “theme” based on the origin or type of cuisine served.
many restaurants have a distinct style of decor, and create a specific ambiance for the comfort of their clientele.
some have a unique location or are housed in a unique building.
but not all restaurants are considered theme restaurants.
diners choose restaurants first and foremost based on type of food.
conversely, theme restaurants attract customers primarily by promising unique experiences.
popular chain restaurants in the united states such as applebee's and bennigan's, despite having distinct and consistent styles, are not usually considered theme restaurants, since they attract patrons primarily with the food they serve.
while food is usually less important than experience, some theme restaurants use food to reinforce their themes.
for example, restaurants themed to 1950s america frequently have jukeboxes from that era, but some also limit their menus to hamburgers and french fries, as would have been common at the time.
the food at theme restaurants is often common in order to have broad appeal, but may be given colorful names to further the theme.
for example, the planet hollywood in london offers specialty cocktails named after movies.
in some cases, customers may visit a theme restaurant only to shop or be entertained, without intending to eat.
theme restaurants have the potential for high profits in a relatively short period of time, in part by selling merchandise.
though arguably a type of theme restaurant, dinner theater restaurants are usually classified separately, despite consumers choosing them primarily for entertainment.
irish pubs and other similar ethnic restaurants that originated in a particular country but are now found around the world are considered theme restaurants by some, as they use theming to re-create an "authentic" experience.
== history ==.
modern restaurants date to back to eighteenth century france.
by the early nineteenth century, they had been introduced in america.
in the late 1800s, restaurants began using theming to differentiate themselves from increasing competition.
in the 1890s, at least three different elaborately themed nightclubs were operating in paris, using themes of death, hell, and heaven.
similar restaurants soon opened in new york city.
in the early twentieth century, so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures became popular for restaurants, including buildings shaped like vehicles, animals, and even the food they served.
this theming was largely a response to the growing popularity of the automobile, as the buildings themselves became advertisements aimed at passing motorists.
beginning in the 1920s, a number of novelty architecture buildings were constructed in and around hollywood, including the famous brown derby restaurants and bulldog cafe.
restaurants such as clifton's cafeteria also started playing with grand decorations based on non-traditional "kitschy" themes, and movies helped fuel the desire by the average american to travel the pacific.
ernest raymond beaumont gantt opened don the beachcomber, generally recognized as the first tiki bar, in los angeles in the 1930s.
along with a neighbor, he collected old fishing nets, driftwood, and other ephemera from local beaches, and added bamboo and masks to theme his restaurant and evoke the south pacific and polynesian culture.
around the same time, another archetypal bar, trader vic's, was created by victor bergeron in oakland, california.
tiki culture became very popular in 1950s america, and polynesian themed restaurants had spread to london by the early 1960s, and further into europe and asia by the 1970s.
though arguably not the first theme park, the opening of disneyland in 1955 popularized the idea of an amusement park combining multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes.
the term "theme park" came into use circa 1960, likely to describe the many parks built across the united states and around the world following disneyland's success.
as theming became more popular, the word was applied to other types of attractions, including "theme restaurant" and "themed hotels.
david tallichet took inspiration from disneyland when he opened his first theme restaurant the reef in long beach, california.
his company went on to open dozens of restaurants, with themes ranging from new england fishing villages and french farmhouses to aviation and world war ii.
another fan of disneyland, atari co-founder nolan bushnell, integrated food, entertainment, and an arcade into the first chuck e.
cheese's, opened in san jose, california in 1977.
the restaurant featured animatronic animals that bushnell claims were inspired by the enchanted tiki room at disneyland.
the north american theme restaurant chain medieval times was actually started on the small island of mallorca, spain in the 1970s.
jose montaner put on his dinner show for years before attracting enough investors to open a location outside walt disney world in florida in 1983.
now their "castles" are found across the united states and canada.
the original hard rock cafe was founded in 1971 in london.
in 1979, following the donation of guitars by eric clapton and pete townshend, the cafe began covering its walls with rock and roll memorabilia.
today, this pioneering theme restaurant chain has some 185 locations in 74 countries.
following hard rock cafe's successful theme of exhibiting music memorabilia, planet hollywood extended the concept to movies in the 1990s, while adding celebrity endorsements and appearances at the restaurants.
steven schussler came up with the idea for rainforest cafe, and actually turned his house into a model jungle to attract investors, before opening the first location in the mall of america in 1994.
dozens of locations around the world quickly followed, and many new theme restaurant chains opened in hopes of copying rainforest cafe's success.
but by the late 1990s, dozens of theme restaurants closed, including entire chains, as the market became saturated and the novelty wore off.
today, though smaller than at its peak, the industry has rebounded, in part as millennials turn to themed restaurants for dining entertainment.
the popularity of social media platforms like instagram has pushed restaurants to theme their physical spaces to inspire photographers.
temporary pop-up restaurants and bars are capitalizing on the popularity of nostalgia by using theming to immerse guests in their favorite programs and movies.
== controversy ==.
many theme restaurants create environments that are considered exotic because they are largely inaccessible to much of the public (such as rainforests and remote tropical islands), or no longer exist (because they are set in a past time period).
however, some use subjects that are supernatural or taboo, and thus controversial.
from the very beginning, restaurants in paris, new york and san francisco attracted bohemian artists and writers with themes including assassination, imprisonment, death, and hell.
more recently, the modern toilet restaurant chain in asia, and the similar but short-lived magic restroom café in california offered diners the opportunity not only to sit on toilets while dining, but to also be served dishes in miniature toilet bowls.
the alcatraz e.
various "shows" were put on by costumed staff to scare guests.
it closed on may 31, 2018.
perhaps the most infamous modern theme restaurant is cross cafe, originally named hitler's cross, outside mumbai, india.
opened in 2006, it included a swastika on its sign, which it was quickly forced to remove.
the owner was seemingly unaware of the holocaust, and claimed only to have wanted a "catchy name.
" still, the original restaurant had very little theming beyond the name and logo, apparently limited to a large portrait of adolf hitler, and in its current form it would not be considered a theme restaurant.

in architecture and spatial design, atmosphere refers to the sensorial qualities that a space emits.
atmosphere is an immediate form of physical perception, and is recognised through emotional sensibility.
architects and designers use the notion of atmosphere to argue that architecture and space is designed and built for people to use and experience.
peter zumthor in his book atmospheres constitutes architectural atmospheres as  "this singular density and mood, this feeling of presence, well-being, harmony, beauty.
under whose spell i experience what i otherwise would not experience in precisely this way".
== about ==.
spaces of atmosphere are shaped through a bodily interaction with architecture.
the atmosphere is therefore closely linked to a philosophy of phenomenology and the analysis of topography.
vitruvius noted that since the human body is the measure of architecture, it is also that which determines atmospheric qualities.
it is the human body that emanates the structural qualities of architecture.
drawing from vitruvius’ discussion of architecture, a number of twentieth-century architects have adopted a phenomenological interpretation of their work, to understand architecture’s primary concern as the body in space.
among these architects include; peter zumthor, steven holl and juhani pallasmaa.
their architectural works draw from the philosophical tradition of maurice merleau-ponty and martin heidegger, the correlation of the body and its sensory-motor functions.
merleau-ponty in phenomenology of perception asserts that, “the body and mind cannot be separated as subject and object”.
the perception of the body influences what is perceived by the mind.
german philosopher gernot böhme has also expanded on the architectural atmosphere, in his essay "atmosphere as the subject matter of architecture".
he addresses the nature of space as the physicality of an actual space and the atmospheric qualities that are embedded within a space.
böhme states that “we must be physically present” (p.
402) to experience space in its complete entirety.
by inhabiting space individuals can sense the character that surrounds them.
inhabitants sense its atmosphere.
photography, written articles and the interpretation of other viewers of a space cannot compare to individual experience and interaction in interior spaces.
spaces begin as voids, tangible and undefined structures, its atmospheres are articulated through cognitive subjects (memory, perception, judgement, emotion) and physical presence.
recently an italian philosopher tonino griffero addresses the theory of atmospheres in a thorough and systematic way, examining the role of atmospheres (underestimated in traditional aesthetics) in daily life and their main ontological and phenomenological characteristics, and aims to consider atmospherical feelings and moods (including pain, shame, twilight, gaze, felt-bodily isles, etc.
) as protypes of the new ontological category of quasi-things.
== features of architectural atmospheres ==.
several aspects of architectural and spatial design have been identified as contributing to atmosphere:.
light.
light that fills a room can give the impression of a space being serene, exhilarating, gloomy, celebratory or creepy.
spaces are experienced by the mood transmitted within.
peter zumthor describes his interest in light, which is crucial in creating atmospheres within his architecture –  “…daylight, the light on things, is so moving to me that i feel almost a spiritual quality.
when the sun comes up in the morning – which i always find so marvelous… and casts its light on things, it doesn’t feel as if it quite belongs in this world.
i don’t understand light.
it gives me the feeling there’s something beyond me, something beyond all understanding” (atmospheres, p.
61).
böhme outlines the concept; that stage design, like architecture provokes emotions and atmosphere.
this sense of atmosphere is enhanced “not only of objects, wall and solids, but also of light, sound, colour…” japanese novelist junichiro tanizaki in his book in praise of shadows describes atmospheres poetically, through space and light within japanese thought and practice of inhabiting in variations of darkness.
“an empty space… a mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquillity holds sway” (p.
33).
the mystery and ambiguity of shadows created by light are primary atmospheric conditions of interior spaces.
the relationship between light and architecture occurs inevitably.
light, depending on how it is used can transform the spatial context.
it can make a space seem pleasant or unpleasant, moving or ambiguous, light also plays with scale or it could be used simply to highlight elements within a space.
light makes space more enjoyable, comfortable, inhabitable and visible.
object.
jean baudrillard in the system of objects used the term ‘atmosphere’ within the context of interior design to refer to the status image of consumption.
the functional interior design, in baudrillard’s description, is created of the combination of objects.
this gives interior design its function.
objects within a space are constructed rather than inherent.
objects determine spaces of place.
the objects placed in an interior create a certain atmosphere sought by the inhabitant.
objects act as replacements, products of mass production.
putting objects in a space is a means of expressing yourself.
thus the interior, through a series of cultural connotations takes on its ‘atmospheric’ qualities, where the term is used to describe a personal expression of status.
peter zumthor’s view on objects within a space is that –  “the idea of things that have nothing to do with me as an architect taking their place in a building, their rightful place… it’s a great help to me to imagine the future of rooms in a house i am building, to imagine them actually in use” (atmospheres, p.
39).
objects in a space give a sense of identity and expressiveness to place.
objects can acquire both tangible and intangible qualities, for example; an idea, memory, colour, furniture, smell, light and texture.
these are all atmospheric features present within architecture.
air.
air encapsulates buildings.
building are said to be alive.
by inhabitation, life is given to interior spaces through imagination and presence.
air in buildings forms an atmosphere.
steven connor in his essay "building breathing space" states, “like the sky, space [is] mobile, mutable, perturbed, polymorphous, subject to stress, strain and fatigue.
the most important agitations of space [are] sound, heat and odour" (p.
3).
connor expresses that these agitations are carried by air and fill space.
buildings defend and sustain their interiority; air creates an apparent atmosphere within architecture.
materials.
materials create architectural atmospheres.
materials can be transformed in multiple ways to obtain certain atmospherics in architecture and spaces.
for example a stone can be split, cut, sawed, drilled, polished and with each process it will have a different quality.
materials are also combined with other materials in a building that play with texture, colour, temperature and tone; all of which create an atmosphere and mood.
for zumthor, “materials react with one another and have their radiance, so that the material composition gives rise to something unique.
material is endless” (atmospheres, p.
25).
sound.
peter zumthor outlines that, “interiors are like large instruments, collecting sound, amplifying it, transmitting it elsewhere.
that has to do with the shape peculiar to each room and with the surface of materials they contain, and the way those materials have been applied.
” (atmospheres, p.
29).
sounds are associated with certain rooms, places and memories.
empty spaces still produce sound through the stillness and silence of scale and materials.
sound in architecture is heard through physical presence and sensitivity.
sound induces emotional and sensual responses.
material, scale, memory and familiarity all create a sense of sound inside a building.
it is up to individuals within a space to identify and associate with the sounds present.
sound is both a tangible and intangible sensational atmospheric quality.
it allows the individual to physically hear, as well as feel and sense the characteristics present in architecture.
