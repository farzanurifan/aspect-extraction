0,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . "
1,"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . "
2,i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . 
3,( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
4,"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . "
5,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
6,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
7,"4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . "
8,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) "
9,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
10,4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
11,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
12,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
13,"i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . "
14,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
15,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! "
16,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . "
17,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
18,it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them ! 
19,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
20,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . "
21,"the more i work with it , the more i love it ! "
22,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
23,i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
24,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . "
25,"i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . "
26,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . "
27,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! "
28,four megapixels is great . 
29,"i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me . "
30,"if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download . "
31,"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . "
32,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . "
33,it is a very amazing product . 
34,i highly recommend it . 
35,just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
36,takes excellent photos . 
37,night mode is clear as day . 
38,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . "
39,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
40,"however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . "
41,overall it is the best camera on the market . 
42,i give it 10 stars ! 
43,this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 . 
44,i just bought the camera a few days ago . 
45,"before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings : "
46,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) "
47,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . "
48,i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . 
49,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . "
50,i bought this last week through amazon . 
51,got a great deal from a reputable seller . 
52,i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . 
53,took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
54,"great colors , pictures and white balance . "
55,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
56,it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for . 
57,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . "
58,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
59,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . "
60,i do n't think i was asking too much . 
61,any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . 
62,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
63,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
64,i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . 
65,that meant even less light and just as much action . 
66,"sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . "
67,the grain was terrible . 
68,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
69,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . "
70,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . "
71,the camera was a marvel . 
72,getting the printer to help output them was another tale . 
73,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
74,"for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . "
75,you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . 
76,then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
77,"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera . "
78,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
79,"me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) . "
80,sure . 
81,"it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output . "
82,"i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . "
83,"i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . "
84,"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . "
85,"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . "
86,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
87,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . "
88,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . "
89,"as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . "
90,"at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . "
91,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
92,"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . "
93,now what about the flash problem ? 
94,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . "
95,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . "
96,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . "
97,"for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . "
98,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . "
99,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . "
100,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . "
101,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . "
102,"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . "
103,"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . "
104,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . "
105,the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . 
106,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . "
107,"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . "
108,the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . 
109,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! "
110,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . "
111,i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . 
112,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . "
113,i didnt wait to experiment . 
114,"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . "
115,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
116,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! "
117,the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
118,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
119,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . "
120,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
121,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . "
122,"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . "
123,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
124,my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . 
125,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . "
126,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . "
127,"i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . "
128,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . "
129,"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . "
130,"or save time and just do it , you won't regret it . "
131,"after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . "
132,"the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . "
133,i 'm very glad i did . 
134,the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
135,the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
136,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . "
137,"recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition "
138,-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . 
139,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . "
140,"the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . "
141,in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
142,about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
143,this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . 
144,but who cares ? 
145,i always shoot using the lcd panel . 
146,i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
147,"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . "
148,but canon never fails to amaze . 
149,some of the great gains over g2 -- 
150,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
151,"2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . "
152,3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
153,"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . "
154,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . "
155,a big plus in my book . 
156,"5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . "
157,the light auto-correction is awesome . 
158,you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
159,"6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . "
160,"there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . "
161,7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . 
162,i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . 
163,"( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). "
164,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . "
165,"in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . "
166,"9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . "
167,personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
168,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . "
169,there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . 
170,short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
171,this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
172,i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade . 
173,big mistake . 
174,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
175,got way too many blurry pictures . 
176,i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
177,"when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 . "
178,"yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . "
179,"not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . "
180,her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
181,the nikon 's are great cameras . 
182,"+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . "
183,"- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format . "
184,olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body . 
185,"+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . "
186,"- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . "
187,photos had some artifacts and noise . 
188,my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands . 
189,we also looked at the fuji fps602 . 
190,"nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again . "
191,fiance did n't like the feel . 
192,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) "
193,"a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more . "
194,"the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own . "
195,"i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . "
196,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! "
197,the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
198,why ? 
199,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
200,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . "
201,it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
202,make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! 
203,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . "
204,"prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . "
205,"no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . "
206,this is not the same thing as a film camera .
