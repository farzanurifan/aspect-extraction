1,does your apex-dvd-player only play dvd-audio without video ? ,,
2,or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ? ,,
3,"before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex-tech-support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first . ",,
4,no picture : ,,
5,hopefully you still have the remote control . ,,|control!remote
6,"if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it . ",,
7,"using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . ",,corner!right|control!remote|press!located|button!i/p

10,"if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car ! ",,
11,picture-scrolling in b/w : ,,
12,you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard . ,,
13,press the p/n-button located on the bottom right corner of the remote . ,,p/n-button!located|press!located|corner!bottom|corner!p/n-button
14,the p/n-button switches your dvd players video output-signal between pal and ntsc . ,,|output-signal!video|pal!video|ntsc!pal

17,i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex-dvd-player with these troubleshooting tips . ,,apex-dvd-player!enjoy|hope!helped
18,i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video-signal . ,,
19,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! ,i/p button!+,person!happier|im!happier|button!i/p
20,the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place . ,,|screen!black|place!first|place!screen
21,"but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex-dvd-player , i love it ! ",dvd player!+,
22,it practically plays almost everything you give it . ,dvd player!+,
23,i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr-sound from the motor . ,player!+,
24,for the price it is a well spent investment ! ,price!+,
25,i would recommend buying one . ,,
26,i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 . ,,
27,"this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . ",dvd player!+,
28,"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front-panel-button layout , and it has a great feature-set . ",look!+,layout!good|front-panel-button!good|feature-set!great
29,its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . ,forward!+|rewind!+,
30,"it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . ",video format!+,
31,and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? ,price!+,price!great
32,i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . ,,
33,strengths are well listed by other reviewers . ,,
34,"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . ",play!+|dvd-r!+,
35,it sure does ! ,dvd-r!+,
36,that 's a rare and valuable feature . ,dvd-r!+,|feature!rare
37,"i have a dvd-burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) ! ",,
38,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . ",audio output!+,thing!nice|audio!digital|unit!optical
39,"saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable . ",,|cable!expensive
40,"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! ",forward!+,
41,"i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo . ",,feature!rare|wish!same|wish!feature
42,"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom-setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .

94,the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend . ,,|range!main
95,"( he had owned two apex-dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) ",player!+,
96,"the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd-formatting .

100,i also did n't like the way it displayed information-way down into the screen when you are in zoom-mode . ,zoom mode!-,way!like
