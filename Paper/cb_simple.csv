40,here were my requirements in a digital camera : ,,|camera!digital
41,"1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while . ",,8x10!great|while!8x10

46,"depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . ",,
47,a few things that might make it even better : ,,
48,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . ,indoor picture!-,|setting!indoor
49,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . ,delay!-,

136,the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more . ,,par!lag|speed!compact|advance!next|frame!next|shutter!par|card!high|12x!high|couple!advance|salesperson!recommended|flash!high
