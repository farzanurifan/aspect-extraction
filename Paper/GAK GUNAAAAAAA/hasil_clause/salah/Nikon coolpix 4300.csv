18,i love-photography . ,,
19,i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera . ,,

24,i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon-powershot-s400 . ,,
25,reason for two ? ,,
26,it was not easy sharing one with my teen age-kid . ,,
27,the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . ,,
28,i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever . ,,
29,"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; ",picture quality!+,picture!good|nikon!headaches
30,1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . ,transfer!-,
31,"i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card-reader . ",,way!only|frustration!many
32,card-reader is included . ,,
33,"2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on . ",,
34,"3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip . ",,
35,i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar . ,,lexar!wrong
36,be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries . ,,battery!low
37,"the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree . ",,camera!good
38,"but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though , ",,
39,. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . ,auto mode!-,
40,would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . ,,
41,". if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . ",,
42,so if you use your card-reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time . ,,software!open
43,"in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time . ",,directory!different
44,. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image ,image!-,
45,. images taken indoor were n't so clear . ,indoor image!-,
46,you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit ,,flash!well
47,. lens cap is a really annoying ,lens cap!-,
48,. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . ,,
49,"else with simpler viking-cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture-quality  "" image-size : 1600 . ",,image-size!fine|picture!fine|viking-cf!simpler
50,. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . ,movie!-,
51,but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture-clarity ; an exceptional close-up-shooting-capability . ,camera!+|picture!+|close-up shooting!+,camera!good|picture-clarity!good
52,i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture-quality ; image-size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix . ,,rate!picture-quality
53,"within a year , there are problems with my menu-dial-knob . ",menu dial knob!-,year!problems
54,it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes . ,,

56,"worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! ",,cost!worse
57,they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor ! ,,
58,"it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer-service . ",camera!+,nikon!sucks|camera!good
59,"got a "" system-error "" problem 30 days after purchase . ",system error!-,
60,made the camera totally inoperable . ,camera!-,

65,"still , had to send it back to nikon for repair . ",,
66,i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world . ,,world!digital|piece!amateur
67,"nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . ",camera!+,camera!best|feel!best
68,here were my requirements in a digital camera : ,,
69,"1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while . ",,
70,2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . ,,
71,i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . ,,camera!decent
72,"3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . ",,
73,"4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . ",,
74,"depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon-powershot-s400 models . ",,
75,"nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand-name , good software that is included and previous reviews . ",,price!compact|software!compact
76,i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since . ,,
77,the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . ,picture!+,
78,a few things that might make it even better : ,,
79,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . ,indoor picture!-,
80,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . ,delay!-,
81,3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . ,picture!-,
82,"all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . ",,
83,try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . ,,
84,"whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory-card i bought a 256 mb-card , usb-card-reader , camera-bag and the warranty . ",,camera-bag!additional
85,"and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak-picture-maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak-processing in terms of clarity and brightness . ",,
86,hope this review has helped you in making up your mind . ,,review!helped
87,i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience . ,,experience!loved

97,"even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10-print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" . ",print!+,

109,pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry . ,,
110,pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent . ,,
111,"the store-clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models . ",,button!understandable|press!understandable

237,an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . ,,investment!extra
238,"3 the picture-editing-software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . ",software!-,picture-editing-software!adequate
239,i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . ,,
240,one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . ,,thing!indoor
241,"just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine . ",,kitchen!dark|door!light
242,"in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality-point and shoot camera in the medium-price-range . ",camera!+,camera!love|camera!recommend
243,"- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera . ",,camera!love
244,i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful . ,,
245,i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash-unit . ,,
246,"i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . ",,hand!left|flash!left
247,"i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring-adapter , lc-e 900 lens-cap , and the nikon 28mm-filter-set . ",,
248,this provides added protection for the camera-lens and allows the use of filters . ,,
249,i leave the adapter and uv-filter on all the time . ,,
250,this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens-cap . ,,
251,"the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens-cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find . ",,mm!expensive
252,great camera . ,camera!+,

259,do n't let my five star-rating-fool you . ,,
260,the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six . ,,
261,i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . ,camera!+,
262,"i was considering buying the minolta-f-100 and the sony-dsc-p 9 , but at the camera-shop , realized this one went above and beyond . ",,
263,i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . ,picture quality!+,quality!high
264,autofocus feels exactly like my film-camera while scene and manual-mode add a little fun-challenge to it all . ,autofocus!+,fun-challenge!little
265,i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash-type i memory-card . ,,battery!extra|battery!recommend
266,buy this camera and savour it . ,,
267,i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one . ,,

273,i am extremely satisfied with this camera . ,camera!+,

282,i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos . ,,wildlife!better|zoom!optical
