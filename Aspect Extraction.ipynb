      "seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . \n",

      "maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . \n",
      "sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . \n",
      "i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . \n",
      "the grain was terrible . \n",
      "well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . \n",
      "when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . \n",
      "it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . \n",
      "the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . \n",
      "what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . \n",
      "relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . \n",
      "fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . \n",
      "contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . \n",
      "the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . \n",
      "now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! \n",
      "the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . \n",
      "what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . \n",
      "without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! \n",
      "but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . \n",
      "i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . \n",
      "i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . \n",
      "this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . \n",
      "battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . \n",
      "manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . \n",
      "not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . \n",
      "having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . \n",
      "by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . \n",
      "the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . \n",
      "in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . \n",
      "about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . \n",
      "being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . \n",
      "1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . \n",
      "2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . \n",
      "3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . \n",
      "a big plus in my book . \n",
      "the light auto-correction is awesome . \n",
      "you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . \n",
      "8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . \n",
      "overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . \n",
      "this is quite simply the best you can ask for . \n",
      "the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . \n",
      "got way too many blurry pictures . \n",
      "+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . \n",
      "- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . \n",
      "4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) \n",
      "i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . \n",
      "the powershot g3 is a great camera . \n",
      "because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! \n",
      "4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . \n",
      "it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . \n",
      "the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . \n",
      "it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . \n",
      "canon 's g3 does it consistently . \n",
      "it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . \n",
      "i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . \n",
      "unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . \n",
      "this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . \n",
      "i love the quality of the pictures . \n",
      "they look fantastic . \n",
      "the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . \n",
      "with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . \n",
      "i love the eos based controls and easy menus . \n",
      "1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . \n",
      "though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display \" lens \" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself . \n",
      "2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . \n",
      "it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . \n",
      "i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! \n",
      "this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! \n",
      "another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! \n",
      "am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! \n",
      "i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . \n",
      "forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer . \n",
      "very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . \n",
      "the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . \n",
      "the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . \n"

      "it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! \n",
      "also , the display is \" hinged \" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . \n",
      "one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . \n",
      "another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . \n",
      "i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . \n",
      "bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations . \n",
      "in general it is easy to use and well laid out . \n",
      "it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . \n",
      "the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . \n",
      "in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . \n",

      "it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box . \n",
      "the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . \n",
      "this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . \n",
      "i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; \n",
      "yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . \n",
      "in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! \n",
      "the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . \n",

      "to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . \n",
      "when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . \n",
      "everything else about the camera is great . \n",
      "if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . \n",
      "however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much . \n",
      "i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . \n",

      "the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : \n",
      "i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : \n",
      "i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . \n",
      "the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . \n",
      "and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . \n",
      "i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . \n",

      "canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . \n",
      "simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . \n",
      "the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . \n",
      "the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . \n",
      "even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . \n",
      "definetely a great camera . \n",
