0,"i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . "
1,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . "
2,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . "
3,"a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . "
4,( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
5,overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
6,"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . "
7,"with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . "
8,"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . "
9,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
10,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . "
11,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . "
12,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
13,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
14,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) "
15,"4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . "
16,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) "
17,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
18,4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
19,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . "
20,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
21,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
22,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . "
23,i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . 
24,"i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . "
25,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
26,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . "
27,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . "
28,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! "
29,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . "
30,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . "
31,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
32,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . "
33,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . "
34,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! "
35,overall it is the best camera on the market . 
36,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . "
37,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . "
38,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . "
39,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
40,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . "
41,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
42,"sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . "
43,the grain was terrible . 
44,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
45,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . "
46,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
47,then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
48,"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . "
49,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
50,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . "
51,"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . "
52,now what about the flash problem ? 
53,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . "
54,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . "
55,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . "
56,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . "
57,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . "
58,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . "
59,"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . "
60,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! "
61,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . "
62,"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . "
63,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! "
64,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . "
65,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
66,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . "
67,"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . "
68,"recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition "
69,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . "
70,in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
71,but who cares ? 
72,"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . "
73,but canon never fails to amaze . 
74,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
75,"6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . "
76,"9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . "
77,personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
78,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . "
79,got way too many blurry pictures . 
80,"yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . "
81,"not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . "
82,her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
83,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) "
84,"i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . "
85,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! "
86,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
