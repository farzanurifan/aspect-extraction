0,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . "
1,"i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . "
2,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . "
3,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . "
4,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
5,"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . "
6,"as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . "
7,"a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . "
8,some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
9,( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
10,overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
11,i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
12,"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . "
13,"i won't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . "
14,"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . "
15,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
16,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . "
17,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . "
18,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
19,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
20,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
21,3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
22,"4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . "
23,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . "
24,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) "
25,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
26,4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
27,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
28,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . "
29,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . "
30,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
31,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
32,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
33,"anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . "
34,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
35,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . "
36,i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . 
37,"i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . "
38,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
39,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . "
40,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . "
41,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! "
42,once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . 
43,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . "
44,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
45,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
46,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
47,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . "
48,"i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . "
49,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . "
50,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! "
51,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . "
52,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . "
53,overall it is the best camera on the market . 
54,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) "
55,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . "
56,took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
57,"great colors , pictures and white balance . "
58,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . "
59,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . "
60,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
61,"sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . "
62,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
63,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . "
64,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
65,"for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . "
66,then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
67,"i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . "
68,"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . "
69,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
70,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . "
71,"at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . "
72,"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . "
73,now what about the flash problem ? 
74,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . "
75,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . "
76,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . "
77,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . "
78,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . "
79,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . "
80,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . "
81,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . "
82,"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . "
83,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! "
84,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . "
85,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . "
86,"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . "
87,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! "
88,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . "
89,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
90,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . "
91,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . "
92,"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . "
93,the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
94,"recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition "
95,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . "
96,in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
97,but who cares ? 
98,but canon never fails to amaze . 
99,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
100,3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
101,"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . "
102,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . "
103,"6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . "
104,"in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . "
105,personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
106,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . "
107,there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . 
108,"yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . "
109,"not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . "
110,her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
111,"+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . "
112,"+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . "
113,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) "
114,"i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . "
115,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! "
116,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
117,make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! 
118,"prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . "
