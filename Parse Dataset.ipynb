      "overall i 'm happy with my toy .  ['camera[+2][p]']\n",
      "1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )  ['size[-2][u],weight[-2][u]']\n",
      "2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )  ['design[-2][u]']\n",
      "those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .  ['use[+2][u]']\n",
      "the more i work with it , the more i love it !  ['camera[+2][p]']\n",
      "i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !  ['camera[+3][u]']\n",
      "seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .  ['camera[+2][u]']\n",
      "it is a very amazing product .  ['product[+3][u]']\n",
      "i highly recommend it .  ['camera[+3][p]']\n",
      "i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .  ['use[+1][u]']\n",
      "maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .  ['picture[-3][u]']\n",
      "it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .  ['price[-3][u]']\n",
      "sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .  ['camera[-2][u]']\n",
      "it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .  ['camera[+3][p]']\n",
      "i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .  ['camera[+2][p]']\n",
      "this is quite simply the best you can ask for .  ['camera[+3][p]']\n",
      "it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .  ['delay[-1][u]']\n",
      "canon 's g3 does it consistently .  ['delay[-2][u]']\n",
      "they look fantastic .  ['picture quality[+2][p]']\n",
      "i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !  ['performance[+3][p]']\n",
      "i am very pleased with it so far .  ['camera[+2][p]']\n",
      "yes , i recommend it over the competition .  ['camera[+2][p]']\n",
      "it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !  ['design[+2], feature[+2],use[+1][u],battery[+2]']\n",
      "in general it is easy to use and well laid out .  ['use[+1][u],design[+1][u]']\n",
      "while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .  ['size[-1][u]']\n",
      "yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .  ['distortion[-1][u]']\n",
      "it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .  ['picture[+2],feel[+1][u]']\n",
