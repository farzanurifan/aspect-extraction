55,28,I have stayed in the city a lot and was blown away at the customer service I received from Allison. She was accommodating and got us in a little before check-in time and even put us in a great room with a view. 
56,28,Rooms were clean and the hotel quiet. 
57,28,The bellman was awesome too!
58,29,What is so special about having a hotel room on this particular floor is that a single hotel elevator is designated to be used only for its guests and so this elevator travels one stop from the hotel lobby to the 18th floor and then back within just a few minutes thereby eliminating the time one may waste traveling in an often slower hotel elevator. 
59,30,Check-in tonight for a business trip. I usually stay further downtown but everything was sold out. Was greeted by the receiptionist Aerial who helped me with my surroundings and also gave me breakfast for my one night here. No complaints from me!
60,31,Staying at this hotel and I just wanted to acknowledge Aerial for great customer service. The hotel does not have umbrella and she let me use her personal one which was so nice of her. Thanks again Aerial

62,32,But the traffic is horrible.
63,33,Great location very near to everything. 
64,33,Not here for the rooms just here to see the city so the condition does not matter to me really.

133,64,Guillermo is an excellent employee with a very good disposition and kindness to help every guest. Looks like he really want everybody to have a great experience while enjoying the hotel and the city. Truly amazing person and very valuable person for the hotel. Thanks
134,65,Hotel service is excellent. We stopped for breakfast but were delayed. Both Dolly and Mohammed at the breakfast service went out of their way to help us out and opened up breakfast for us - We could not have asked for a more friendly and warm staff. Setting a new standard for service.
135,66,"I choose this property based on location. It reads as a 3 until 4 star hotel but in reality its a  1 until 2 star hotel!!!! Service was exceptional which made up for the physical hotel. the elevators were filthy, the hallways were untouched for at least 30 until 40 years and extremely depressing and makes you question why you are staying there. "
136,66,the room itself was most likely redone around 20 until 25 years ago and the bathroom was disgusting. 
137,66,"Floors, baseboards and bathtub were all dirty and worn out. "
138,66,I travel around the world and would never recommend this property with so many choices in NYC!!!! 
139,67,"Mohammed and Dolly are the best breakfast hosts! They made sure me and my girlfriend ate well and catered to our needs. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the manhattan time square hotel, the room was nice and clean, and the breakfast was delicious"
140,68,The customer service in this hotel is top notch especially from Mohammed and Delores at the breakfast bar. Our family was treated very well and both of them did everything in their power to make our stay memorable. Thank you guys! We will definitely come back on our next visit to NY!
141,69,"Very friendly and warm service , helpful people .kind attention to Details."
142,69,we very happy with our Breakfast . Enjoyed the Breakfast here . Everything is very Good and Nice. 
143,69,"Best location in Manhattan area ,"
144,70,Had wonderful friendly service from Mohammed and Dolly. Lovely people. And concierge Gloria also very helpful.
145,70,Hotel is very good location close to everything . 
146,71,The only good thing about this hotel was the location! 
147,71,Avoid this hotel it was filthy carpet not hoovered and the bath had hair in it and a dirty scum ring around it! Toilet was loose.
148,71,The room was outdated and desperately needed painting horrible furniture. Limited tea and coffee. 
149,71,Staff were ok. 
150,72,Check-in late and was promised a suite and when I reached the hotel that room was not available.
151,72,Aerial was kind enough to help me out and to find a better room for my gift birthday. Really appreciate her
152,73,Choosing this place was definitely the best decision ever. 
153,73,"I met Allison Sarvic, the receptionist. She was suchh a great human being. Her customer was beyond exceptional. She received us with a great smile. Wow."
154,74,"I met Alam, He make me feel like home. It was really nice meeting him. Honestly this is the first time I see that. He was very professional. Excellent service. Everything was perfect. Think you very much. "
155,75,Choosing this place was a best idea. I would like to come back.
156,75,Our first time to the Big Apple to celebrate my retirement from the Army and my wife birthday. 
157,75,Great location with a balcony overlooking Times Square. 
158,75,Got to the room and the air conditioner was broken. 
159,76,"Thank you very much Alam and Allison for the great service provided at The Manhattan hotel. Alam carried out baggage to the room, showed us how to have the coffee machine, and told us about places to see in the New York. Allison provided quick service during the check-in process. We will definitely visit this hotel again during the next New York City trip."
160,77,"They are amazing!! They give us early check-in and birthday gift! They answer all our questions and they are so nice!!   Alam explain to us where is the water machine, all the services, the coffe machine.   Great experience with them!!"
161,78,"I like this hotel very much, the location is wonderful."
162,78,Thanks especially to Mohammed and Dolly for our delicious breakfast. They are kind and professional even with our babies.
163,79,Arrived at the hotel for one night tonight just to have some Friday night fun in the city. Ariel helped us find a cool sports bar and a hookah lounge. Thanks for the suggestions. Will definitely be back soon
164,80,disappointed in the rooms
165,80,the breakfast was great 
166,80,the service at this hotel is some of the best service I ever experienced in New York. 
167,80,Thank you Aerial for being so helpful and understanding our frustrations.
168,81,Hotel is centrally located on 7th Ave midway between Times Sq and Central Park. 
169,81,"The hotel itself is desperately in need of renovation. The rooms are furnished with horrible old dark wood furniture that was chipped and stained , the bathroom was grimy and the lack of a fridge is bizarre these days. The floor mounted air conditioning unit in the bedroom was ancient and noisy. The corridors outside were shabby and the carpets manky. The walls are wafer thin and we were kept awake by the shouting of other guests or constant banging and crashing from outside. "
170,81,It is the first hotel I have stayed in in NYC were I felt genuinely uneasy lying in bed. Being charged $9 for a bottle of water was the final straw. 
171,81,I would not stay at the Manhattan Hotel again. I suggest you do not either.
172,82,"When we arrived... the room was nothing like the pictures....old and used up, but the air conditioner worked when we arrived. "
173,82,"We went to dinner and when we got back the air conditioner was making a terrible sound, we called for maintenance at 9:30, by 11:00 they said they could not fix it. "
174,82,"Luckily they had another room, the new room had a soft renovation on a different floor. "
175,82,"We were happy with it. It was clean, newer and the air worked. When we left on Saturday, a bell person held our luggage while we went to breakfast. "
176,83,"Very helpful, helped us check-in early and carry bags to the room. Very friendly and outgoing personality. He is also very funny! He also recommended places to eat around NYC! Thanks Mohammed, you are awesome!"
177,84,"The experience with this hotel, staff, and especially Alam was wonderful. They were very accommodating with our luggages and needs from the moment we walked in. Alam brought our bags upstairs to the room and was friendly throughout which is all you really need in a hotel, friendly and helpful staff."
178,85,"When arriving at the Manhattan at time square, we received a fantastic welcome by Alam, he was most helpful showing us to our room, showing us how to use the WiFi and all other facilities.  Thanks again for all your help after the long flight we had."
179,86,"We had a fantastic stay at The Manhattan at Times Square! We received amazing service from Alam and Mohamed during our stay and would highly recommend to friends and families! The friendly, personable approach of these guys made all the difference and made our stay super special! We will be back! Thanks for a great trip!"
180,87,"Great service when we arrive  To hotel, They are  The WiFi , breakfast, the international call  Had an incredible stay at the Manhattan at Times Square because the staff here is phenomenal !!  The hotel is very good"
181,88,"I am enjoying my stay over here, I check-in yesterday on my birthday and I am loving it"
182,88,the staff is really nice and welcoming specially Mr. Mohammad who helped me with my check-in and gave us a really nice room on 20th floor with a cool view of the New york city. 
183,88,It is a very old hotel in the heart of new york city with all modern amenities
184,88,amazing location . I highly recommend it.  
185,89,The lobby is beautiful but our rooms were outdated and shabby. 
186,89,The location is perfect but hope by the time we get to visit again it is had some work. 
187,89,They provide a grab and go breakfast sack lunch style which is a great idea. 
188,89,All the employees were friendly and helpful.
189,90,We received amazing customer service from Senka at the front desk. She took great care of us from the minute we walked in. She gave us great tourist advice! 
190,90,This hotel is AMAZING and right in the middle of where all the action is.
191,91,"Location, location, location! Made a pit stop here in Times Square and this location was perfect. "
192,91,I really wish the company would update the hotel because it is definitely the place to be when in Times Square. 
193,91,Ariel checked us in and helped us out with cool restaurants for our short stay
194,92,"Such a great hotel for staying with your family,or like couple or even friends, "
195,92,"all the staff are so nice and they enjoy helping people when they are in need , specially SENKA ,she is the best one so helpful "
196,93,Checked into this hotel last night and it was very hectic when I arrived. I could overhead hear the receptionist telling others that their rooms were not ready at 9pm. VERY ANNOYING! For them and a guest. 
197,93,I wanted to take the time to do this review to commend Aerial because she did an excellent job handling the situation. Not only for myself but the other guests I witnessed her helping!
198,94,Service was good 
199,94,but the hotel itself was not great.
200,94,"It is not 4 star, like it says.  The smell in the lobby is over powering and the rooms are worn down.  "
201,94,"Watch out for the hidden costs of £50+ for a facility fee at the end of our stay ??? Like what even is that! The hotel we stayed in previously the night before, had no additional costs, therefore we felt cheated. Not worth it!"
202,95,Its my first time in USA and the stay in this hotel made it even more memorable. 
203,95,"The rooms are spacious, comfortable and the view outside is fantastic. "
204,96,The staff is extremely helpful and I must mention Mr. Mohammed Chowdary at the breakfast counter for his excellent communication skills.
205,97,"Our first time in New York, in the hotel at six in the morning Mohammad was great he helped us get a room with a king size bed in less that an hour. Great stuff! "
206,97,"but the bed had or probably still has a left and right dimple very uncomfortable, "
207,97,but the most annoying thing it had no television and the smell of smoke from the neighbors was intense. 
208,98,If you want a budget hotel in a central location this place is great.
209,98,If you can afford it upgrade to executive as we stayed there for a night and it felt 5*.   
210,98,The breakfast guys mohammed and William were amazing. They always have a smile on their faces and are extremely helpful.  
211,98,Beware Baggage people only want tips and will actually ask for them whilst talking to you passive aggressively. 
212,98,Similarly a woman working at the help desk tried selling tour bus tickets for three days and got angry when we refused.  
213,98,"To finish on a possitive note you are 10 minutes walk away from central park, the empire state building and Times Square."
214,99,Mohammed Chowdury is the light is the whole establishment. We had a chance to chat and I was shocked to learn that he has been with this hotel since 1984. He is so kind and super friendly to all the guests. The smile on his face makes you want to return for a coffee refill. 
215,99,My room was so great and with a nice view and the bed was very comfortable. 
216,99,"I will definitely return to this hotel for Mohammed, indeed. Joseph!"
217,100,"Amazing location, "
218,100,"helpful staff, shout out to aerial who gave us breakfast when we check-in. The little things go a long way and we appreciate it. I mean who doesnt love free Starbucks coffee in the morning?"
219,101,"Our first time in new york, its our first time here. We are from belgium we like the hotel alot "
220,101,Senka from the desk was verry helpfull! Im happy to be here! 
221,101,The hotel is close to both times square and central park.
222,102,Rooms are outdated but there are some slightly renovated ones. 
223,102,The agent Ariel was fantastic and helped me get into one of those! Thankkkkkkssssss Ariellllllllllllll
224,103,Guillermo is very welcoming and help me with my accommodations. Originally my room came with one bed but Guillermo helped me in a pitch to find a room with two beds. I came to sight see with my dad and spend a couple days over here.
225,104,"There were bugs in the bathroom, coating the shower. Mold in shower. In smelled so bad that I would not shower in it. "
226,104,"I complained they cleaned it making it smell better, but the mold was still there and the bugs just came back. "
227,104,I found out they have a contract with the city and house homeless people. The contract is guaranteed income and they are not concerned with return customers. Bad experience!
228,105,"While the decor is dated, our room was clean. "
229,105,The staff are very friendly and helpful. 
230,105,"The location is perfect. Far enough from the crowds but close enough that you can walk to many of the main attractions like Time Square, MOMA, Rockefeller Centre."
231,106,Guillermo  Very helpful and accommodating with all of my needs. Ive travel extensively through the world and I must say he is an awesome individual. Made me feel like anything I need he would assist. 
232,106,The rooms are clean and well organized. 
233,106,"Employees are very friendly, but Guillermo was the highlight of my trip."
234,107,Good location. Value for money. 
235,107,Room size are good. 
236,107,Good city view from Hotel. 
237,107,One thing bad- No Free Internet. 
238,107,Shopping area- tourist attraction point at Manhattan all are near by walking distance. Overall good place to stay.
239,108,The room quality was extremely poor. Dated and not comfortable even though we upgraded. The bathroom was dirty and unpracticle. The toilet sounded like a small explosion when flushed. 
240,108,The breakfast set-up however was good and the grab and go was perfect for taking out when exploring the city. 
241,108,The location was perfect for broadway and times square but was insanely busy at peak times. Whilst you should expect this we would probably prefer a midtown location and to travel into Times Square etc when you want. 
242,108,"Overall would not recommend this particular hotel to anyone, needs a lot of work. "
243,108,"The staff actually were annoying and would pester you every time you walked past, sometimes you just want to get on with your day."
244,109,"He is the best, he is always care about you. He is a very helpful person, we have all our breakfast at the bar and it was really nice. Thank you so much for your service and to make our breakfasts really good."

249,111,"As I got an upgrade to the executive class floor, I could use the dedicated superfast elevator for the 18th floor. "
250,111,"In my room I had two large TVs, a couch, one super comfortable bed, a pretty large bathroom and a walk in closet. "
251,111,From the bedroom I could look at the Radio City building.  In the lobby you will find a bar serving starbucks coffee in the morning. They also serve all kind of breads and some fruits.
252,112,Central to all the sights good location. 
253,112,Basic hotel that is a bit outdated. 
254,112,Clean rooms 
255,112,No restaurant or bar on the premises so you couldnt relax on the premises after a day out sightseeing 
256,112,Staff were friendly and helpful and full of information when you had a query
257,113,Alam was super friendly and helpful.  Was always around to lend a helping hand for anything that we needed.  He gave us a lovely New York welcome.  Would recommend staying at Manhattan Times Square again

264,118,I think I found the only 2 polite people in this city. Mohammed and Alam were awesome.  
265,118,The hotel is at a great location at a very low price. A month here might actually be cheaper than Manhattan rent.
266,119,"Everything perfect, very good service. They are very attentive and they care because you enjoy an excellent breakfast. I totally recommend to stay at this hotel and to have breakfast at the hotel with them."
267,120,Excellent service and comfortable room. Mohammed and Delores made breakfast time fun.

281,126,"We found the Manhattan a fabulous place to stay. We enjoyed every bit of service and looked forward to the breakfast bar every morning. Mohammed and Dolly were such a pleasure to meet, chat and have a laugh with. They really start your day off on a good note. We will definitely be back to stay."
282,127,Stayed for one night. Front desk was friendly and efficient. 
283,127,Lobby upgraded however the upgrade stopped there. Our room on the 10th floor was a good size but desperately in need of a paint or repapering. 
284,127,There was mold in the grout in the bathroom walls and tub. The hairdryer worked in short bursts The ironing board legs were broken and there were minimal electrical outlets to plug in our phones. No ports for computer or smart phones. No alarm clock! The TV was difficult to use. The AC worked fine. Street noise is loud. 
285,127,The plus was location. 
286,128,"Nice and friendly hotel perfectly located near Times Square in mudtown. For those who need to explore Manhattan it is very convenient.  At the reception Senka was brilliant, very keen to help with a smile."

290,129,"The hotel is also near the biggest attractions in town, like Times Square and the Rockfeller Center, and bear a lot of different places were you can enjoy your meale, like Ellens Stardust where the waiters are Broadways performers... and it also has a subway station really close so you can easily reach it from the airport with public transportation. I would definitely reccomend it."
291,130,"Very old fashioned, "
292,130,service terrible. No one on reception. 
293,130,"Air con broke down and no one attended. The mattress was broke, plug sockets hanging off the walls and wall paper peeling all over. "
294,130,Not worth the money at all such a shame as great location
295,131,"Allison was wonderful, and went above and beyond to make sure we chose the right room. We had plenty of time to explore our options and Allison made sure that we received every accommodation that we were entitled to. Great experience!"

322,148,And the view of Times Square is great.

341,157,Just the location was good but that just it.

349,161,"From the Check-in, Senka was very helpful with the requirements. Senka was nice with my daughters and she advised us what to do as it was our first visit to Manhattan. Next time when we visit NY, we will certainly choose Manhattan at the Time Square."
350,162,This hotel was so bad. 
351,162,"The staff would directly ask you to please leave a good review about them, One employee told me ""This hotel is s**** but please mention good things about me on TripAdvisor"" I found that so terrible. "
352,162,"The hotel itself is really old and disgusting. Mould in the tub and the bed is falling apart. The sink in the bathroom barely works and could not figure out how to turn on the TV. Also, what is this RESORT FEE???? STAY AWAY!"
353,163,The Hotel room was awful.
354,164,"Great service, upgraded room for family from Germany. "
355,164,"Senka was very nice, helpful and kind. Hotel was full of standard rooms and she provided a upgrade free of charge. Will come to this Hotel again on the next visit to NYC."

363,168,"The best part about my stay was the friendly and very helpful staff! I would like to personally thank Mike in bell services, Paolo and Margaruita in Front Desk, and Dolores and Mohammed in the breakfast bar! This group of amazing, awesome people made sure my family and I had everything we needed and more! "
364,169,Upgraded to executive floor as normal rooms are very dated and had a real musty smell. 
365,169,"Location to Times Square is good, lots of bars and eateries nearby. Good foyer area with coffee and food. "
366,169,Some really nice staff.

373,174,I really enjoyed my stay there. 
374,174,The walk to time square was about 2 blocks convenient to everything from high end restaurants to KFC. We loved it. 
375,174,The only disadvantage was no refrigerator or microwave it could be because it is a older hotel.
376,174,Everyone was nice and helpful I would definitely stay there again. 
377,175,"Very friendly! As soon as we check-in, they were both very welcoming. Explained everything we needed to know and established us in our room in a very professional way. "
378,175,"The hotel is in an awesome location, walking distance to a lot of places. "

380,176,Alam was very friendly and helpful he showed us everything we needed to know at the hotel he told us about breakfast service how to make calls internationally where all the fire exits are and Alison gave us a room with a lovely view
381,177,"After a 12 hour overnight bus ride from Toronto due to cancelled flight, we were met by hotel reception staff to inform us that our room was not ready even though the hotel room was fully paid for a week starting 2 day prior so we have to wait till the room is fully serviced. "
382,177,"Thankfully Ms. Dolly and Mr. Mohammed from the lobby cafeteria served us good breakfast, so friendly they talk to us like we were old friends that we forgot how tired we were from the overnight drive from Toronto. These two staff should be given highest appreciation."
383,178,Star was very helpful at check-in we truly are so greatful to have met her during our stay here in newyork she was extremely patient and answered all of our first timer questions. Thank you so much Star
384,179,We recently stayed at Manhattan Hotel Times Square and had the pleasure of meeting Starr during our check-in. She was very patient and went over and above to help us get settled in. She is truly an asset to your establishment.
385,180,"One week at the Manhattan at times, rooms damp and dirty, shower and bath filthy,carpets damp...walls scuffed...shower dripping,.kettle is a cheap coffee maker that dripped out hot water...outdated... only saving grace is zip code and great cleaners."
386,181,Hotel location is right near Times Square. 
387,181,The most impressive thing which I experienced was - Hospitality. I travelled with my family to NY for very first time
388,181,Mrs Senka got to know about it she gave a helping hand to make sure I had all I need for my family. I made a right choice of hotel for my first visit to NY
389,182,Me and my family have been their in holiday it is was strategic position with very professional staff . 
390,182,"Room very clean, "
391,182,design and modern  WiFi very good quality  
392,182,Room service very discreet and professional  the equipment is like 4 stars
393,183,We were tired and early for check-in this is our fifth time to this hotel. Mohammed helped us to get room early and gave us information. Thank you so much.
394,184,"The worse hotel I have ever stayed in, so dirty and smells stale, rooms have never been hovered the bedding had stains on the, the bathroom was covered in mould"
395,184,the staff do not care they are rude.
396,184,We ended up paying more and moving to the Sheraton across the road
397,185,I would never recommend this hotel! only the position is excellent. 
398,185,The rooms are old and the bathrooms are not clean. 
399,185,the staff is not excellent at all. 
400,185,"I forgot two jackets in the closet of my room and I communicated what happened by mail, telephone and messenger. Nobody gave me information. I called them several times and they hung up on me! It is unacceptable that my jackets have disappeared and no one is able to give me an answer. this means that the staff is unreliable. I want to clarify that I communicated my forgetfulness only one day after the check-out."
401,186,"We had a very good time at the hotel which is in a great location for many shops, restaurants and transport. "
402,186,The hotel is old but clean.
403,186,"The staff are very friendly especially Valerie very professional and great, thank you."
404,187,Senka is one of my favorite employees at The Manhattan Hotel at Times Squre. Senka works at the front desk and is always helpful and accommodative to my requests. Ricardo is another favorite and is friendly and helpful. I travel often to New York for work and love the location and accommodations.
405,188,"I love the location of this hotel, it is walking distance to everything. "
406,188,Our flight was a red eye and Mohammed at the front desk did his very best to get us in a room earlier then the check-in time. He was so kind and awesome. My two favorite employees are Mohammed and William at the Grab and Go Breakfast. 
407,188,"They are so friendly and kind and greeted my daughter and I with a smile and conversation every morning. My daughter had a sore throat and William jumped at making her a hot drink for her throat. I have stayed at the hotel a few times and the service and friendly employees keeps me coming back. I was in the hotel business for many years and this hotel cares about customer service and going the extra mile. Praise to all your staff and especially Mohammed and William from the Grab and Go, they are friendly and kind."
408,189,"What a disappointment! When I walked into the lobby, I knew it was going to be bad. "
409,189,"The lobby furniture was disgustingtorn and stained sofas, scratched up tables it looked like a furniture youd see on the curb. "
410,189,So then the room...it stunk! Smelled like cat pee. 
411,189,The night stand had some stickers all over it. I guess the hotel did not care that someone let their toddler decorate. The walls needed to be washed.
412,189,It desperately needs to be updated. 
413,189,The only good thing I can say about our stay was that the staff was friendly. 
414,189,But I will never stay here again and I will make sure none of my friends pick this dump either.
415,190,Arrived today and rather disappointed with actual quality of our stand family room compared to the images shown on bookings.com and tripadvisr - rather dated and a little 3 star. On the other hand Senka on the front desk has been 5Star with some great advice and service to make our stay better.
416,191,"Excellent accommodation, welcoming and helpful stuff, especially the lady called Senka, she was a wonderful person, warm-hearted and kind. Id love to stay here for more, but I guess another time than. Amazing vacations!"
417,192,"Guillermo treated us well, suggested us on what all we can plan to do in New York. Also assisted us with an early check-in. "
418,192,The lobby of the hotel is nice. Getting a room with a view on 21st floor. We are all set to have a good time in New York.
419,193,The front desk people were very helpful specially Mohammad.  
420,193,Only issue was that the rooms were small and needs uplifts.
421,194,Hotel is great. I stayed here last year. All employees are wonderful and friendly to me. Senka from the reception checked me in and she was really helpful. I am highly thankful and happy to be here. All the great things to say.
422,195,Thought the size of the room was great. 
423,195,The room was clean with the beds made daily. 
424,195,"Overall, the hotel is a little dated. The walls are very thin so we could hear people in the surrounding rooms. The TV did not work but we were out exploring most of the time so it did not bother us too much. This is a no frills, budget hotel"
425,195,in an excellent location.

462,214,"We have stayed at this hotel for well over 30 years, back to when it was a Sheraton. "

Staff at the front desk gave me room 2238, check-in and check-out were each fast and easy. "
468,217,Stayed for just a night but was very impressed. It was the best deal during peak season in this location. Big shout out Aerial at reception who gave us an awesome room

475,219,Charged a resort fee of 34 dollars per night for wifi and water. Cannot recommend.

479,220,We had a fantastic service from Senka in the reception. In general we were met with great hospitality from all staff. 
480,221,This hotel has to be seen to be believed. We arrived at the hotel late at night and had requested a room away from the elevators. Our room was directly facing the elevators. The front desk spent time arguing how we could have been closer to the elevators. I am not sure how
481,221,Thanks to the manager who eventually relocated us. 
482,221,The corridors are in desperate need of repair with scratched doors etc. 
483,221,The room itself is not properly cleaned. 
484,221,When the bathroom floor gets wet the grime and black shows on the floor. Really not pleasant. 
485,221,The hotel has a fab location and should be attracting great reviews. 
486,221,Hopefully a refurbishment will be planned along with some staff training to make this a wonderful and special place to stay.
487,222,"Guillermo was extremely helpful when we came in and asked for a room the afternoon of august 8th.

495,224,"But overall, very pleasant stay, clean hotel in great location. We would stay here again."
496,225,"I booked this hotel because the Park Central was not available. It looks good from the outside. Unfortunately, that is where the good looks ended. The carpet on our floor was buckled and ripped in places. The bathroom had mold all over the 1970 pink tile. The beds were comfortable but did not even have bedspreads. It is a good thing we just stayed one night on a layover. "

I was scared because it was my first time to New York and I was by myself. However Allison made me feel so welcome. Let me feel as if I was not alone. She made the stay so wonderful I wished I could have stayed for more than just one night. I know that my stay would have been even more wonderful. Everyone smiled at me and made me feel so welcomed.
