0,i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . ,canon powershot g3[+3]
1,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . ",use[+2]
2,"after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . ",
3,"i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . ",
4,they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . ,picture[+2]
5,a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . ,picture quality[+1]
6,i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . ,picture quality[+1]
7,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . ",
8,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . ","camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]"
9,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . ,"picture quality[+3], use[+1], option[+1]"
10,great job canon ! ,
11,yep . ,
12,"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! ",camera[+2]
13,"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . ",
14,"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . ",picture[+2]
15,"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . ",use[+1]
16,"+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. ",
17,"as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . ",
18,i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . ,
19,"a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . ",
20,some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). ,
21,* main dial is not backlit . ,dial[-1]
22,* lens visible in optical viewfinder . ,viewfinder[-2]
23,( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . ,
24,i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . ,
25,"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . ",
26,"following my research , i decided on the g3 . ",
27,"in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera . ",camera[+3]
28,"i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . ","speed[+2],picture quality[+2],function[+2]"
29,"with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . ",auto setting[+2]
30,"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . ",
31,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . ",camera[+3]
32,"do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . ",
33,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . ,canon g3[+3]
34,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . ,photo quality[+2]
35,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . ",feature[+2]
36,flaws ? ,
37,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . ",viewfinder[-1]
38,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . ,
39,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . ",camera[+2]
40,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . ,camera[+2]
41,the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . ,photo quality[+3]
42,"i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . ",
43,"i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . ",
44,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) ",darn diopter adjustment dial[-1]
45,i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . ,
46,positives ,
47,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . ","exposure control[+2],auto setting[+2]"
48,excellent range of metering options as well . ,metering option[+2]
49,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . ,spot metering[+1]
50,2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) ,4mp[+1]
51,3 ) 4x zoom is nice ,zoom[+1]
52,"4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . ",
53,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . ,focus[+2]
54,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . ",focus[+2]
55,negatives ,
56,4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . ,viewfinder[-2]
57,the camera has a wonderful set of features . ,"feature[+2], "
58,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . ,lcd[+2]
59,you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . ,
60,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . ,"optical zoom[+2],digital zoom[+1]"
61,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . ,picture[+3]
62,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . ",picture[+3]
63,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . ",software[+2]
64,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . ,"lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]"
65,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . ,"menu[+1],button[+1]"
66,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . ,camera[+3]
67,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . ,camera[+3]
68,advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . ,control[+2]
69,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . ,auto setting[+2]
70,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . ,photo quality[+3]
71,do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . ,
72,"unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . ",
73,"anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . ",
74,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . ,"zoom[+2],lense[+2]"
75,i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . ,
76,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! ,camera[+3]
77,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . ","picture[+3], control[+2], battery[+2], software[+2]"
78,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . ,"photo quality[+2], auto mode[+2]"
79,absolutely breathtaking . ,
80,i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . ,
81,"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . ",
82,"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . ",
83,i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . ,
84,what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ? ,
85,"i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . ",
86,"at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons . ",
87,"i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife . ",
88,"i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it ! ",
89,"this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . ",canera[+2]
90,the prints are beautiful ! ,print[+2]
91,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . ,
92,"i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected . ",
93,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . ",battery[+1]
94,this is a great camera for you ! ,camera[+2]
95,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . ","control[+2],auto mode[+2]"
96,i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! ,
97,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . ",control[+2]
98,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . ",photo[+3]
99,warning - i did read the manual ! ,
100,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! ",control[+2]
101,once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . ,
102,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . ",dial[+1]
103,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . ,manual mode[+2]
104,it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them ! ,
105,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . ,"feel[+2],weight[+2]"
106,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . ",feel[+2]
107,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! ,
108,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . ",camera[+3]
109,"i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . ",
110,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! ","picture[+2], auto mode[+2]"
111,four megapixels is great . ,four megapixel[+1]
112,"i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me . ",
113,"if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download . ",
114,"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . ",
115,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . ",
116,just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . ,feature[+2]
117,takes excellent photos . ,photo[+2]
118,night mode is clear as day . ,night mode[+2]
119,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . ,viewfinder[-1]
120,"however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . ",
121,overall it is the best camera on the market . ,camera[+3]
122,i give it 10 stars ! ,
123,this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 . ,
124,i just bought the camera a few days ago . ,
125,"before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings : ",
126,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) ",picture quality[+3]
127,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . ",lens cover[-2]
128,i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . ,
129,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . ",zooming lever[-2]
130,i bought this last week through amazon . ,
131,got a great deal from a reputable seller . ,
132,i love this camera . ,camera[+2]
133,i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . ,
134,took hundreds of pictures and they were great . ,picture[+2]
135,"great colors , pictures and white balance . ","color[+2],picture[+2],white balance[+2]"
136,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . ,optical zoom[+1]
137,it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for . ,
138,i do n't think i was asking too much . ,
139,any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . ,
140,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . ,
141,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . ,camera[-3]
142,i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . ,
143,that meant even less light and just as much action . ,
144,"sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . ",
145,the grain was terrible . ,grain[-3]
146,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . ,
147,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . ","flash photo[-3],noise[-2]"
148,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . ",photo[+3]
149,the camera was a marvel . ,camera[+1]
150,getting the printer to help output them was another tale . ,
151,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . ,
152,"for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . ",
153,you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . ,
154,then again a one time use camera may do just as well . ,
155,"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera . ",
156,"me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) . ",
157,sure . ,
158,"it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output . ",
159,"i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . ",
160,"i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . ",
161,"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . ",
162,"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . ",
163,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . ,
164,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . ",g3[+1]
165,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . ","lag time[-2],flash[-2]"
166,"as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . ",
167,"at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . ",
168,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . ,depth[+1]
169,"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . ",
170,now what about the flash problem ? ,
171,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . ",flash[-2]
172,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . ",external flash hot shoe[+1]
173,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . ",
174,"for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . ",
175,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . ",
176,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . ",flash[+2]
177,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . ",
178,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . ",
179,"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . ",
180,"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . ",
181,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . ",
182,the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . ,
183,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . ",
184,"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . ",
185,the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . ,
186,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! ",software[-2]
187,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . ",software[-2]
188,i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . ,
189,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . ",
190,i didnt wait to experiment . ,
191,"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . ",
192,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . ,g3[+3]
193,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! ",color[+3]
194,the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . ,"g3[+3],software[-2]"
195,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . ,software[-2]
196,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . ",
197,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . ,image[+3]
198,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . ",raw image[+3]
199,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . ,camera[+3]
200,my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . ,
201,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . ",battery life[+1]
202,whoa . ,
203,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . ","manual function[+2],picture quality[+3]"
204,"i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . ",
205,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . ","viewfinder[-1],lcd[+2],camera[+3]"
206,"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . ",
207,"or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it . ",
208,"after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . ",
209,"the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . ",
210,i 'm very glad i did . ,
211,the service from the supplier was exceptional . ,service[+3]
212,the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . ,
213,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . ",photo[+3]
214,"recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition ",
215,-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . ,
216,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . ",photo[+3]
217,"the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . ","automode[+2],manual mode[+2]"
218,in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . ,
219,about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . ,viewfinder[-2]
220,this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . ,
221,but who cares ? ,
222,i always shoot using the lcd panel . ,
223,i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! ,camera[+3]
224,"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . ",
225,but canon never fails to amaze . ,canon[+3]
226,some of the great gains over g2 -- ,
227,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . ,raw format[+2]
228,"2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . ",battery life[+1]
229,3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . ,software[+2]
230,"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . ",
231,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . ",shape[+1]
232,a big plus in my book . ,
233,"5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . ",
234,the light auto-correction is awesome . ,light auto correction[+2]
235,you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . ,picture[+2]
236,"6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes . ",
237,"there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . ",
238,7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . ,
239,i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . ,
240,"( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). ",
241,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . ",white offset[+2]
242,"in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . ",
243,"9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . ",
244,personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . ,
245,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . ",g3[+3]
246,there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . ,
247,short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .,
248,i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade . ,
249,big mistake . ,
250,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . ,low light focus[-2]
251,got way too many blurry pictures . ,picture[-3]
252,i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! ,
253,"when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 . ",
254,"yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . ",
255,"not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . ",
256,her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . ,
257,the nikon 's are great cameras . ,
258,"+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . ",
259,"- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format . ",
260,olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body . ,
261,"+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . ",
262,"- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . ",
263,photos had some artifacts and noise . ,
264,my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands . ,
265,we also looked at the fuji fps602 . ,
266,"nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again . ",
267,fiance did n't like the feel . ,
268,the canon g3 . ,
269,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) ","photo[+3], use[+3], software[+2]"
270,"a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more . ",
271,"the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own . ",
272,"i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . ",
273,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! ",
274,the powershot g3 is a great camera . ,camera[+2]
275,why ? ,
276,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! ,photo[+3]
277,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . ",camera[+2]
278,it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . ,feature[+1]
279,make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! ,
280,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . ",unresponsiveness[-2]
281,"prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . ",
282,"no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . ",
283,this is not the same thing as a film camera . ,
284,and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs . ,
285,they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet . ,
286,"most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . ",
287,"but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw : ",
288,i am not talking milliseconds . ,
289,picture this : ,
290,"your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment . ",
291,"when it arrives , you press the shutter release . ",
292,splash ! ,
293,"the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot . ",
294,perhaps there is a way around this delay . ,
295,"some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get . ",
296,"yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay . ",
297,"yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash . ",
298,"but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera . ",
299,i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . ,
300,it focuses in a snap . ,
301,"dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board . ",
302,"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . ","focus[-2], shoot[-2]"
303,i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . ,
304,"and so i must ask , what are cameras for ? ",
305,what task do they perform ? ,
306,cameras capture moments . ,
307,they stop time . ,
308,"because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back . ",
309,"the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras . ",
310,"a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture . ",
311,"not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . ",
312,"like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . ",
313,so buy the g3 . ,
314,"buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . ",
315,"but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose . ",
316,"from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to . ",
317,"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . ",g3[-2]
318,this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . ,camera[+3]
319,i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it . ,
320,i love the quality of the pictures . ,picture quality[+2]
321,i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens . ,
322,it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments . ,
323,the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . ,4mp camera[+2]
324,"i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital . ",
325,"with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . ",picture[+2]
326,i love the eos based controls and easy menus . ,"control[+2],menu[+2]"
327,i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . ,
328,many before me have done that already . ,
329,i agree with the positive reviews . ,
330,but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews . ,
331,1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . ,lens cap[-2]
332,"though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself . ",
333,"i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens . ",
334,very cheaply made . ,
335,"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . ",body[-2]
336,the g2 was better in this respect . ,
337,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . ,casing[-2]
338,"despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera . ",
339,i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it ! ,
340,"there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted . ",
341,"i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research . ",
342,"canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives . ",
343,"i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands . ",
344,"needless to say , the canon won , hands down . ",
345,this camera performs like i can not believe ! ,
346,"it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode . ",
347,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! ",camera[+3]
348,another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! ,battery life[+3]
349,"i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one . ",
350,"i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying . ",
351,this camera will stay with me for years ! ,
352,i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time . ,
353,"after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 . ",
354,am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! ,camera[+2]
355,"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . ",camera[+2]
356,forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer . ,
357,i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual . ,
358,very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . ,menu[+2]
359,"i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged . ",
360,the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . ,battery[+2]
361,i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures . ,
362,"the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . ","optical zoom[+3],viewfinder[+1]"
363,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . ",viewfinder[-2]
364,"as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever . ",
365,"these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives . ",
366,the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . ,camera[+3]
367,highly recommended . ,
368,"for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews . ",
369,you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions . ,
370,"i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ? ",
371,because this camera is beautiful . ,camera[+3]
372,the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely . ,
373,the g3 looks like a work of art ! ,look[+3]
374,"its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . ",finish[+3]
375,"the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them . ",
376,this is my first digital camera . ,
377,i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time . ,
378,this seemed like a really good compromise . ,
379,"i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 . ",
380,"based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal . ",
381,it is not perfect though . ,
382,here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far : ,
383,it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera . ,
384,you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . ,viewfinder[-2]
385,"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . ",tiff format[-2]
386,that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw . ,
387,"to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power . ",
388,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? ,lag[-2]
389,trips . ,
390,( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . ) ,
391,for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop . ,
392,it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . ,import[+2]
393,"i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok . ",
394,i am quite happy with the camera . ,camera[+2]
395,it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . ,manual[+2]
396,"best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . ",camera[+3]
397,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . ",stitch picture[+2]
398,i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this . ,
399,"for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer . ",
400,i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera . ,
401,"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . ",picture[+2]
402,save them on computer and print out just the ones who want . ,
403,duplicates are a no brainer and cheap . ,
404,no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers . ,
405,crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time . ,
406,"the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier . ",
407,a great new use for that underutilized computer . ,
408,a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use . ,
409,"poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film . ",
410,this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . ,camera[+2]
411,"my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera . ",
412,"and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) . ",
413,get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash . ,
414,"in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots . ",
415,i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 . ,
416,"unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one . ",
417,"i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera . ",
418,you can always spend more money to get a better one . ,
419,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . ",camera[+3]
420,"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . ",display[+2]
421,excellent idea ! ,
422,"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . ",compactflash[-2]
423,"however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras . ",
424,another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . ,noise[+2]
425,i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . ,camera[+2]
426,it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. ,camera[+2]
427,bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations . ,
428,for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor . ,
429,it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . ,"use[+3],control[+2]"
430,the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . ,feature[+2]
431,"in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . ",auto mode[+1]
432,"my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again . ",
433,the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses ! ,
434,this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this . ,
435,negative points : ,
436,the included memory card is too small . ,memory card[-2]
437,"go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense . ",
438,it is made of plastic . ,made[-2]
439,"for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience . ",
440,"this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure . ",
441,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . ,lens[-1]
442,this is not a handbag camera . ,
443,the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . ,lever[-1]
444,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . ",flash[-1]
445,the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography . ,
446,the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . ,strap[-2]
447,"if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble . ",
448,good points : ,
449,the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . ,camera[+2]
450,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . ,"option[+1}, control[+1]"
451,learning how to use it will not take very long . ,learning[+1]
452,the image quality is excellent . ,image quality[+3]
453,"messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results . ",
454,"unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough . ",
455,range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . ,function[+1]
456,please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used . ,
457,a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film . ,
458,i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first . ,
459,this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . ,camera[+2]
460,it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box . ,
461,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . ,"macro[+2], auto mode[+2]"
462,this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . ,camera[+2]
463,beats that sony f717 ; its archrival . ,
464,i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; ,4mp resolution[+1]
465,i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways . ,
466,please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story . ,
467,my story is based on personal usage . ,
468,moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon . ,
469,the distortion is not a flaw . ,
470,"as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand . ",
471,i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this . ,
472,"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! ",shot[+2]
473,the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . ,"picture[+3],learning curve[+1]"
474,"in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery . ",
475,"based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots . ",
476,i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash . ,
477,the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it . ,
478,"anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 . ",
479,it 's a winner . ,
480,"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . ",picture quality[+2]
481,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com . ,
482,they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's . ,
483,that 's what i did and hopes this helps . ,
484,the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . ,camera[+2]
485,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . ",viewfinder[-2]
486,"( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on . ",
487,"you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product . ",
488,"although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of . ",
489,"after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product . ",
490,"i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" . ",
491,"one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" . ",
492,so why lie about it ? ,
493,so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet . ,
494,"although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it . ",
495,"they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" . ",
496,"they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though ! ",
497,"although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint . ",
498,i cancelled the order . ,
499,hope to get my refund in a timely manner . ,
500,"thanks for nothing , amazon ! ",
501,this camera has a major design flaw . ,design[-3]
502,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . ,viewfinder[-2]
503,i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera . ,
504,"after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera . ",
505,everything else about the camera is great . ,camera[+2]
506,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . ",camera[+2]
507,"however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much . ",
508,i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected . ,
509,"i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control . ",
510,"i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price . ",
511,i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far . ,
512,"there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures . ",
513,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . ","lens[+2],optical zoom[+1]"
514,the moveable lcd screen is great . ,lcd[+2]
515,"you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself . ",
516,"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . ",remote[+2]
517,"i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before . ",
518,the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : ,hot shoe flash[+1]
519,i chose the canon speedlite 420 . ,
520,"this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting . ",
521,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : ",battery[+2]
522,i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery . ,
523,"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . ",battery charging system[+1]
524,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . ",manual[+1]
525,"you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do . ",
526,negatives ? ,
527,"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . ",highlight[-1]
528,( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . ) ,
529,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . ",no-off button[-2]
530,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . ",body[-2]
531,"i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution . ",
532,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . ",download[+1]
533,i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : ,
534,i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly . ,
535,"at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough . ",
536,"if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software ! ",
537,"and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers . ",
538,"the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you . ",
539,but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately . ,
540,added 2-24 . ,
541,i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . ,camera[+3]
542,i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting . ,
543,"it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings . ",
544,"if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper . ",
545,"i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker . ",
546,especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations . ,
547,i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) . ,
548,very easy to use . ,
549,"i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too . ",
550,"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . ","camera[+3],use[+1],photo[+3]"
551,i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . ,g3[+2]
552,"after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) . ",
553,"it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more . ",
554,this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features . ,
555,"it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice . ",
556,"all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . ",camera[+3]
557,"the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera . ",
558,canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . ,optic[+2]
559,"simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . ",digital camera[+3]
560,"the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage . ",
561,for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card . ,
562,the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . ,battery life[+2]
563,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . ",look[-2]
564,"even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . ",camera[+3]
565,definetely a great camera . ,camera[+3]
566,proven canon built quality and lens . ,"quality[+2],lens[+2]"
567,feels solid in hand . ,feel[+2]
568,rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . ,"weight[-1],camera[+2]"
