       "['i recently purchased the canon-powershot-g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . ',\n",
       " 'the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . ',\n",
       " 'after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . ',\n",
       " 'i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . ',\n",
       " 'they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . ',\n",
       " 'a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture-quality . ',\n",
       " 'i am easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture-quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . ',\n",
       " \"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash-card as with any of the 4mp cameras . \",\n",
       " 'bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . ',\n",
       " \"i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . \",\n",
       " 'great job-canon ! ',\n",
       " 'yep . ',\n",
       " \"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! \",\n",
       " 'i am a software-engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . ',\n",
       " \"just a little overview , powershot-g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot-series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . \",\n",
       " 'whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . ',\n",
       " '+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. ',\n",
       " 'as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . ',\n",
       " 'i am using kingston-512mb-cf which works great and is very fast . ',\n",
       " 'a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . ',\n",
       " 'some things that i did not like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). ',\n",
       " '* main dial is not backlit . ',\n",
       " '* lens visible in optical viewfinder . ',\n",
       " '( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . ',\n",
       " 'overall i am happy with my toy . ',\n",
       " 'i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . ',\n",
       " 'a couple of online camera-review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution-sample images to compare amongst the models . ',\n",
       " 'following my research , i decided on the g3 . ',\n",
       " 'in a word , \" awesome \" is how i would describe this camera . ',\n",
       " 'i wo not go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture-quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . ',\n",
       " 'with the automatic settings , i really have not taken a bad picture yet . ',\n",
       " 'and with the panoramic \" stitch \" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . ',\n",
       " 'i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . ',\n",
       " 'do not walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . ',\n",
       " 'i bought my canon-g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . ',\n",
       " 'i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . ',\n",
       " 'the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . ',\n",
       " 'flaws ? ',\n",
       " 'the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . ',\n",
       " 'still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design-flaw before releasing the camera . ',\n",
       " 'despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon-g3-anyone who is serious about digital photography . ',\n",
       " 'i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . ',\n",
       " 'the photo quality is amazing and i know i am going to have fun with all the features . ',\n",
       " \"i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . \",\n",
       " \"i am one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display-panel on top , but that does not stop me from loving this camera . \",\n",
       " \"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter-adjustment-dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do not know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) \",\n",
       " 'i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . ',\n",
       " 'positives ',\n",
       " '1 ) slr like programming and exposure-control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto-exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do not want to bother with the settings . ',\n",
       " 'excellent range of metering options as well . ',\n",
       " \"it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd-screen . \",\n",
       " '2 ) 4mp is about right for the target-market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) ',\n",
       " '3 ) 4x-zoom is nice ',\n",
       " '4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd-screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . ',\n",
       " '5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . ',\n",
       " 'you can move the focus-range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual-focus-mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . ',\n",
       " 'negatives ',\n",
