26,it was not easy sharing one with my teen age-kid . ,,
27,the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . ,,
28,i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever . ,,
29,"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; ",picture quality!+,picture!good|mp!other|nikon!headaches

39,. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . ,auto mode!-,sound!buzzing|t!buzzing
40,would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . ,,
41,". if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . ",,

67,"nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . ",camera!+,camera!best
68,here were my requirements in a digital camera : ,,|camera!digital

73,"4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . ",,camcorder!expensive|brand!respected|course!brand
74,"depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon-powershot-s400 models . ",,

76,i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since . ,,
77,the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . ,picture!+,
78,a few things that might make it even better : ,,
79,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . ,indoor picture!-,|setting!indoor
80,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . ,delay!-,
81,3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . ,picture!-,
82,"all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . ",,
83,try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . ,,
84,"whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory-card i bought a 256 mb-card , usb-card-reader , camera-bag and the warranty . ",,|upto!additional
85,"and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak-picture-maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak-processing in terms of clarity and brightness . ",,

224,we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken . ,picture quality!+,|number!different|camera!number
225,i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! ,camera!+,picture!fanatic|way!same
226,"first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter-lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera-grip to minimize camera-shake .

227,"for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives . ",,
228,and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 . ,,|coolpix!nikon
229,"i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . ",camera!+,camera!exceeded
230,the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . ,picture!+,daylight!brilliant
231,the shutter-lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame-advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed-12x 128mb compact flash-card a salesperson recommended the high speed-card since next frame-advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more . ,,flash-card!compact|speed-12x!compact|frame-advance!next|speed!next|couple!frame-advance|salesperson!recommended|128mb!high|speed-card!flash-card
232,uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . ,image download!+,pc!fast
233,"the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack-contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon-slr . ",indoor shot!-,distance!drawbacks
234,"right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave-flash-unit that 's designed for digital cameras . ",,slave-flash-unit!inexpensive
235,2 the battery-life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . ,battery life!-,|side!short
236,i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour-period before the battery died . ,,battery!died|monitor!battery|hour-period!battery
237,an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . ,,investment!good|battery!back-up
238,"3 the picture-editing-software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . ",software!-,
239,i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . ,,
240,one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . ,,|thing!indoor|camera!many
241,"just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine . ",,kitchen!dark|heck!fine|door!light
242,"in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality-point and shoot camera in the medium-price-range . ",camera!+,camera!love|camera!recommend|quality-point!high|summary!camera|anyone!quality-point|medium-price-range!camera
243,"- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera . ",,camera!love|review!camera
244,i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful . ,,
245,i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash-unit . ,,
246,"i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . ",,|hand!left|flash!left
247,"i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring-adapter , lc-e 900 lens-cap , and the nikon 28mm-filter-set . ",,|step!ring-adapter|lens-cap!step|nikon!28mm-filter-set
248,this provides added protection for the camera-lens and allows the use of filters . ,,
249,i leave the adapter and uv-filter on all the time . ,,
250,this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens-cap . ,,
251,"the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens-cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find . ",,mm!expensive
252,great camera . ,camera!+,camera!great
253,i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . ,use!+,

257,i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots . ,,
258,now where did i put that manual ? ,,
259,do n't let my five star-rating-fool you . ,,
260,the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six . ,,
261,i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . ,camera!+,
262,"i was considering buying the minolta-f-100 and the sony-dsc-p 9 , but at the camera-shop , realized this one went above and beyond . ",,
263,i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . ,picture quality!+,|quality!high
264,autofocus feels exactly like my film-camera while scene and manual-mode add a little fun-challenge to it all . ,autofocus!+,|fun-challenge!little|scene!fun-challenge|manual-mode!scene

278,i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember : ,,camera!confusing
